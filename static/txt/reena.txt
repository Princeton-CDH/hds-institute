BY WAY OF EXPLANATION.
DR. a
R. Bernardo Ruiz Suarez is not a physician.
He is by profession a lawyer, and by inclin-
ation a poet. Another feature about this interest-
ing personality which may be surprising to people
who are not accustomed to referring to a lawyer as
"doctor,” is that what appears to be his middle
name is in reality his last name, as names go in the
United States. The last word of the sonorous ap-
pellation which distinguishes this doctor lawyer
merely indicates that in a large number of coun-
tries where women do not vote, they nevertheless
enjoy the privilege, if not the obligation, of keep-
ing their own surnames after marriage and of
transmitting them to their children. This is some-
thing that the most advanced of feminine feminists
have not secured under the Nineteenth Amend-
ment. All of which goes to show, if nothing else,
that one-half of the world does not know how the
other half lives.
Mr. Ruiz has come to find out and tell how the
people of the United States live. Incidentally, he


## p. 10 (#18) ##############################################

>
proposes to say something as to how the people of
his native Cuba live. He has chosen for a start, a
subject which affords a good basis of comparison,
and in which he is particularly interested. A keen
and active observer, his impressions should merit
the consideration of those who, like himself, are
ceaselessly engaged in the quest and utilization of
knowledge.
In undertaking to express in English the ideas
of Mr. Ruiz, by his request, I have been mindful of
the popular tradition that a translation can never
fully and faithfully represent the original work.
This notion is not without some basis in fact.
When, for instance, a letter in Spanish begins with
the salutation Muy senor mio y de toda mi consid-
eracion, and this is translated into English as “My
dear Sir,” “Dear Sir" or plain “Sir,” to persons ig-
norant of one or both of these languages it is quite
obvious that something has been lost in the trans-
lation.
To the readers of The Color Question In The
Two Americas, I believe that I am justified in of-


## p. 11 (#19) ##############################################

fering the assurance that whatever may have been
lost in the translation from the Spanish original is,
like Iago's purse, "something, nothing.” Some-
thing, perhaps, has disappeared in the number and
form of his words, but nothing has been altered
or subtracted from the ideas of the author of this
book.

FOREWORD.
I
HAD always been seduced by the fantastic
tales which reached my foreign ears and eyes
from the pages of the book of life of the people of
the United States. Ever more insinuating, ever
more persuasive, that seductiveness caused me to
abandon the soil of my beloved Cuba and come to
this land of inconceivable potentialities, so as to
get a closer view of its greatness and an intimate
understanding of its defects. In the following
pages I have essayed to set forth, not in the vein
of a critic but rather as an apprentice and an ob-
server, the impressions which I have received of
that phase of American life with which I have been
chiefly connected.
As an apprentice for "Americanization," the
subject and form of this book may indicate that I
have been apt, for this is not the collection of verses
in which I had hoped to temper the tropical
warmth of my race and my country with the soft
sunshine and melancholy snow of New York. In-
stead of expressing subjective emotions, which
could be of very limited appeal, I have directed my
purpose in a more practical channel, affording at

once an opportunity for self-expression and a sub-
ject of throbbing interest to the vast millions of the
United States.
In presenting my impressions of the color ques-
tion, I need hardly state that I have no theory to
offer, with the force of dogma, for the solution or
attenuation of the problems arising from the rela-
tions of the white and colored races in the United
States. I am simply discussing, in the light of my
experience or knowledge of the black man and his
descendants in parts of Spanish America, my ob-
servations with regard to the colored man as I have
seen and known him in New York. Here, I be-
lieve, is to be found the synthetic, typical colored
man of the United States. Following these brief
sketches of the type, I hope to offer a fuller study
when I shall have observed the variants, in the
Southern States especially.

THE COLOR QUESTION
!
HAVING
AVING devoted myself, as a young man, to
secure, with the aid of other right-thinking
elements, the improvement of the condition of the
colored race in my native land, I early came in
contact, and have since kept in touch, through the
periodical press as well as books devoted to the
subject, with the development of thought and ac-
tion in regard to the problems affecting the millions
of black people of the United States.
In the Spanish-American countries, very little
is known regarding the ability and progress of the
black man of this country. In the social and poli-
tical circles of colored people as such in those coun-
tries, it is a common thing to hear, as an incontro-
vertible postulate of racial and intellectual su-
periority, the statement: "I am not an American
negro." This characteristic expression of contempt
has the force of dogma with people who, being
neither superior nor inferior to the objects of their
contempt, but simply different by training and
education and, to some extent, by ancestry, have
made themselves the standard bearers of racial
aristocracy. Nevertheless, we cannot but forgive
those who think in this way, when we consider the
isolation of the black man of the United States,

which has given rise to the belief, among those who
do not know him, that he is docile, indolent and
unprogressive.
The colored people of Spanish-America are un-
just, or rather mistaken, in their opinion of their
Anglo-American brother. The black race in the
United States has given ample evidence of its
progressiveness in its churches, its theatres, its
manifold efforts for economic independence, in a
word in all the varied activities which, among
civilized peoples, are held to be characteristic of a
progressive race. But, unfortunately, I have
reached the conclusion that the American negro has
not a definite personality, and that such a per-
sonality cannot be distinguished clearly for many
years to come, if ever, in a land of and for white
people.
However, the United States is not the only
country where the blacks are struggling against
absorption by the overwhelming influence of the
white race. Even in the vastnesses of Africa, the
cradle of the black race, white men have gone in
the name of a superior, civilized and civilizing
race, and have enslaved peoples who were by na-
ture free. The European spheres of influence in

the heart of Africa have never represented, in my
opinion, the work of humanity. I have always re-
garded them as manifestations of boundless egoism
and love of conquest. Of course, it cannot be de-
nied that some material progress has been made in
the co? quered territories and, to those who abuse
the word humanity, the enslavement of weaker peo-
ples in the name of humanity has been fully jus-
tified.
It is, therefore, not at all surprising that, in the
countries conquered and colonized by and for the
white race, the blacks have no fixed personality as
a contributing factor in the general activities of
society and are merely a negative quantity in the
field of collective political rights, which are mo-
nopolized exclusively by those who consider them-
selves superior. Throughout history, from the
days of Aristotle down to the present time, there
have been groups of people who held as their ex-
clusive patrimony the right to live the life of ci-
vilization, which they force to the extent they con-
sider suitable, upon those whom they regard as in-
ferior and existing only to serve and obey.
The white race is haughty and domineering
everywhere. In those countries where religion,

education and other influences have softened the
hearts of men, the sentiment of brotherhood tends
to level the inequalities and barriers of race and
to give reality to that form of society which in
Political Science is called Democracy. But the
race which colonized and still forms the majority.
of the people of the United States, with its his-
torical antecedents and its degrading record of
bloodshed, cannot be classified, in the opinion of an
impartial observer, as a democratic race.
With peoples, as with individuals, culture is not
in itself a sufficient meagure of democracy, nor can
it serve its full purpose in civilization, except it
be accompanied with the habit of tolerance, of mu-
tual respect, of reciprocal consideration, and at
times, even sacrifice.
Is the dominant race in the United States dis-
tinguished by the the habit of tolerance merely, not
to say sacrifice, with regard to the effectively sub-
ject race? The reply is frankly negative, isolated
manifestations to the contrary notwithstanding.
Thc look of disdain, the act of discourtesy, of which
the colored people are everywhere the character-
tistic objects, make it wholly unnecessary to cite
specific incidents in proof of what is already com-

mon knowledge. Nevertheless, this general dis-
respect of the whites is not without its positive ad-
vantages for the colored people. The latter know
that they are regarded as inferior. They are not
deceived. They do not have occasion to grasp the
proffered hand of hypocrisy. The black people of
the United States know just where they stand.
They do not occupy a false position in the affairs
of their country.

In the
foregoing lines the idea is expressed that
advantage in the rude frankness with which the
whites make him know his place in their opinion
and in their national organization. It is perhaps
opportune to explain the advantages of the situa-
tion of the black American by comparing it with
that of his fellow in other lands.
In the Spanish-American countries where there
is an appreciable colored population, these people
live in an atmosphere of apparent cordiality with
the white race. The latter, perhaps quite as
prejudiced as the American whites, but not so de-
monstrative, know how to conceal their sentiment
with the mantle of specious kindness and to throw
the same cloak of their hidden but none the less
keen prejudices over the eyes of the colored peo-
ple who, with rare exceptions, are satisfied to trust
in the hypocritical fraternity of their masters.
Living in apparent racial equality, in apparent
community of principles and ideals, the black peo-
ple of those countries have no aspirations other
than those of their white brothers. The person-
ality which the black man might create for him-
self in those countries is nullified and destroyed

by the self-seeking tolerance of men of the race.
Sometimes, as in Cuba, the effort to maintain an
appearance of the absence of racial distinction has,
through the instrumentality of colored men, been
carried to the extent of absolutely prohibiting the
formation, in any guise, of political parties com-
posed of one and the same race.
Stupendous irony! Laws do not change the
sentiments of peoples. Peoples have their laws
changed, by pacific means, if possible, or by force,
when necessary; nor can this be otherwise, for
every violation of right is an invitation to violence
and a symptom of revolt.
From my extended observation of the operation
of the law which prohibits the formation of politi.
cal parties on racial lines in Cuba, I am absolutely
convinced that that law is merely a bit, cruelly
applied to stifle the just demands of the black Cu:
ban who, after sharing with his white countryman
the hardships of the struggle for independence
and, qualifying for the symbols of capacity repre-
sented by the degrees of institutions of learning,
cannot be satisfied to relegate himself to the posi-
tion of the ignorant masses, devoid of ideals, and
play a role inferior to that for which his culture

and the discharge of his duties as a citizen have
fitted him,
After all, it appears that the similar lack of a
definite, affirmative racial personality in the Afro-
Cuban as well as the Afro-American, is traceable
to opposite causes. In the one case, the white man
pretends to give him the hand of fellowship, as to
a brother reared in the same cradle. The Ameri-
can, on the other hand, regards him with haughty
disdain and considers him not at all as a man, a
black man, and a citizen, but simply as a negro, an
indefinite and indefinable thing, a beast at most.
Which of these two methods is more likely to
stimulate the progress of the black man? Facing
this dilemma, the pusillanimous and simple-mind-
ed, the partisans of half-tones, will find acceptable
the principles which govern the tolerance of the
Spanish-American whites, who set up no appar-
ent line of distinction on account of race. But to
strong and noble spirits, to sincere and loyal men,
the methods of the Anglo-Saxon will be prefer-
able. They may be, and they frequently are,
rough and brutal and contemptuous. But they
goad the black man into a life of activity and,
consequently, a life creative of ideals whick may
in time be realized.

THE COLOR QUESTION
N the preceding chapter we have discussed the
absence of what we call the racial personality
of the colored man, not only in Spanish America
but also, and for different reasons, in the United
States. In this country, however, the black man's
lack or a definite group personality is not abso-
lute, as it is in the countries to the South. The
black American has no personality, and, indeed,
no existence at all, in relation to the life of the
white man.
Wherever the two come in contact,
the black man is submerged and asphyxiated.
But, isolated by the white man's frank and un-
compromising prejudice, the black man is obliged
to put forth efforts which result in positive evi-
dence of his collective capacity.
To the black man of Spanish-American origin,
accustomed as he is to the destruction of all ef-
forts looking toward collective progress of his race
in order to preserve a simulated equality of oppor-
tunity which permits the whites to absorb and rep-
resent every cultural principle, it is most gratify-
ing to observe the accomplishments of his congen-
ers in the United States in the development of
their own instruments of civilization.

does found schools for the education of the child-
ren of his race, who receive instruction from
black teachers. He may build theatres, because
he has artists of his own to perform in them. He
may establish financial and commercial associa-
tions, because the race has business men and has
money. But perhaps the most striking character-
istics of the black people of the United States, in
itself as well as in contrast with conditions else-
where, is the development of a church in which
members of the race minister to the spiritual
needs of their fellows.
Not many months ago, the admission of a col-
ored man from Cuba to a seminary in the Canary
Islands was heralded by the press of the Island Re
public as something of a sensation, and continued
for several days to be the favorite theme of the
newspapers. Obviously, the spiritual welfare of the
colored Cuban is either neglected or entrusted to
members of the white race, and these, it may be
said in passing, are, for the most part, of foreign
birth and sympathies. Consequently, the influence
of the ciergy, of one orthodox faith, in shaping the
racial or even the national aspirations of the col-
ored Cuban, is practically nil.

THE COLOR QUESTION
The black American, on the other hand, from
earliest childhood frequents the temples of religion
in which, no matter to what sect the faithful ad-
here, there is always to be noted a fervent devotion
to the Author of all things. In his church, the black
man tempers and invigorates his soul for the strug-
gles of the present life. The word of the pastor
gives form to the heart and mind of his followers
and molds their future not only on principles of re-
ligious doctrine but, in larger measure, of civic
virtue.
One who has lived a life free of religious inter-
ests, whose heart has not been touched by the song
of praise and the sincere expression of piety and
application to the Almighty, can hardly escape the
religious influences of the United States. Wheth-
er by gradual adaptation or impelled by sentiments
hitherto dormant within him, the irreligious
stranger learns to appreciate the spiritual comfort
necessary to mollify the shocks of fate and to give
him strength for nobler and more difficult enter-
prises than those hitherto achieved.
A feature of the church in the United States, as
contrasted with the religious organization of the
Hispanic countries, is the different attitude toward

education. In the latter countries, Church and
School are antagonistic terms, for the one is ortho-
dox and reactionary, while the other is liberal and
progressive in form and substance. The American
School, however, is the complement of the Church,
and the preacher is the colaborator and often the
substitute of the teacher. Not only is the secular
instruction in large measure supervised and con-
trolled by the clergy, but the institution known as
the Sunday School, an immediate adjunct of the
church, exerts an immeasurable influence in shap-
ing the moral and civic as well as the religious.
outlook of youth.
The religion of the American is not a spiritual
garment to be worn on Sunday morning only. It
is carried, consciously or unconsciously, at all..
times. It permeates the life of the people. A
simple but inspiring spectacle which impels the un-
accustomed observer to ponder on the greatness of
God and the smallness of mankind, is presented by
American families when, on taking their seats at
table before a meal, they reverently listen to the
expressions of thanksgiving offered to God by a
member of the party for the bounty of which they
are about to partake.

The black American has, no doubt, acquired this
practice from his white countrymen. But in pre-
serving this and many other useful acquisitions de-
spite his isolation and neglect, the black man of the
United States gives evidence of the great senti-
mental and moral capacity of his race. To main-
tain and enhance these virtues is the task which
the ministers of practical religion are performing
with singular efficiency and with great promise for
the future of the race.

THE COLOR QUESTION
BETWE
ETWEEN the black Spanish-American and
the black man of the United States there is
a notable difference in training and aspirations.
The latter has a more definite point of view toward
the problems of life. He approaches them with
more exact rules and with a spirit of accentuated
idealism toward the realities of life, for to him
there is no antithesis between the ideal and the
real. The black Yankee has not the quixotism of
his Spanish brother, yet he is no less gentlemanly,
frank, ingenuous and sincere. In the home, under
maternal tutelage, he begins to form a comprehen-
sion of the position which he occupies with regard
to the white race. In the school, his ideas and
sentiments receive definite shape and are directed
toward horizons at once worthy and dignifying.
Living in an atmosphere of activity, he cannot
but be industrious. His ideas are accompanied with
action; he does not leave for tomorrow what he can
1
do today, for he knows and appreciates the value
of time and of things. Quick to assimilate, he wel-
comes the opportunities which the white race offers
to study, to observe and to create. If it cannot now
be said that there exists a distinct and character-
istic culture of the black man in the United States,
the time is not far distant when he will have ex-

tracted and assimilated from the white race the es-
sential elements of a solid culture and a worthy
civilization which he may call his own. The path
to this ideal is already traced. All that is needed
is some Messiah, who will surely come, to illumine
with the constant sunshine of intelligent, courag-
eous and self-denying leadership, the way of a peo-
ple able and eager to go forward on the path of
progress.
The sociology of today recognizes no inferior
races, but it does admit the existence of superior
environments. In this sense only, is the black race
inferior to the white, and the black people of the
United States, conscious of their ability, are exer
ing themselves to make their surroundings equal to
those of the whites.
Not so the Hispanic black man. Actuated by
an essentially different training, he complacently
accepts all the initiatives of the white man with-
out the elightest promptings of a creative spirit
pointing the way to a future of independence for
his collective personality. In Cuba, the black man
who enjoys a measure of economic prosperity and
occupies a position of distinction within his race.

sure of service to society when, after pursuing a
course of studies at a university, he busies himself
in politics, secures a good job, even though of less
importance than the office to which he aspires, and
finally settles down to live in the greatest possible
comfort and ease, if not in luxury.
Business enterprises are outside the range of his
vision. He is not concerned about the reform of
the legal systems which keep him in subjection.
He has no desire to inform himself about the hid-
den potentialities of his collective personality. He
is satisfied to trust in the ostensible friendship of
the white race. Unlike his American brother, the
black Cuban has no minister of his own color to
preach to him the practical religion of race ideals.
His teachers may be of his own color, but the ra-
cial consciousness of the black men may not be cul-
tivated in the public schools of Cuba. And so, the
colored Cuban who aspires to the self-dependence
of his race because he realizes the real attitude and
purpose of the whites, remains an impotent specta-
tor of the suppression and distortion of worthy
ideals of group distinctiveness in order to maintain
and ostentate a specious national unity.

States is not merely allowed, but is stimulated and
compelled by the outspoken prejudice of the whites,
to develop a distinctive racial consciousness and
pride. But, whether in the process of formation or
when achieved, distinctiveness almost necessarily
entails rivalry and conflict. And the excessive
.
stimulation, external as well as internal, of the ra.
cial conscioneness of the colored American, is ac-
companied with the ever present danger of a sud-
den and violent reaction. The frequent clashes be-
tween whites and blacks in various parts of this
country are sufficiently indicative of the fact that
the black American's characteristic patience and
humility are not dictated by servile complacency.
His latent spirit of revolt is merely kept in check
by considerations of expediency. Unable to resist
the superior strength of the whites, the black Amer-
ican bears the indignities and hardships inflicted
upon him, with the hope and purpose of ultimately
finding in them the courage and strength to en-
force his claim to a fuller and fairer share of the
common heritage of the people of the United States.
Despite the foregoing remarks, it is the opinion
of this observer that the proper course to be pur-
sued by the black American in his struggle to

keeping with his capacity for progress, lies in
peaceful evolution. This is a slow process, but it
is constant and sure. The relentless effort toward
progress, under the inspiration of competent lead-
ers, will continue to be, as it now is, far more effec-
tive than any outbreak of violence. Revolution
would be suicidal for the black people of the
United States. Peaceful and patient evolution is
the formula for the salvation of a race which is
eager to live. Undue haste and violence must al-
most certainly lead to retrogression and destruc-
tion, as will be illustrated in the following pages
from the history of the colored people of Cuba.

adequately represented in governmental affairs.
While it is true that there were two or three col-
ored members of the House of Representatives,
they had been nominated only as a tardy and inef-
fectual means of appeasing the growing discontent
of the colored people.
At this juncture Estenoz, a man of courage, of
industry and of civic virtue, if not of brilliant in-
tellect, undertook the difficult task of organizing
the political forces of the black people. At times
violent in the language of his initial campaign, but
always liberal in his ideas, he sounded a note of
alarm to the conscience of the whites. Feigning
indifference to the growing intensity of the efforts
of the black leader, they quietly prepared to de
fend themselves against an imaginary attack. De-
spite the opinion of so distinguished a critic as Prc-
fessor Fernando Ortiz, of the Law School of Ha-
vana University, the campaign of Estenoz was nut

a campaign of incitement to violence against thé
life and property of the whites. In the judgment
of all impartial observers, it was merely an effort
of a group of people to obtain, through the peace-
ful activities of a political organization, a fuller
participation in the public life of their country
and a greater measure of respect and consideration
from those with whom they had shared the trials
and sacrifices of the struggle for common independ-
ence and equality of opportunity to serve the com-
mon weal.
At first the government, under the presidency
of General Jose Miguel Gomez, appeared to lend
its moral support to the just demands of the party
of Estenoz, and this apparent sympathy of the au-
thorities gave additional impetus to the movement. .
The colored people began to see, in a not distant
future, the triumph of their aspirations for equal-
ity in fact as well as in the theory of the law.
Beautiful dream, which was shortly to be inter-
rupted by a rude awakening. The government,

force which it might be able to use to its own ad-

pendent Colored Party were arrested on the charge
of conspiracy to rebellion, and incarcerated for sev-
eral months. Finally, it was clearly established
that there had been no conspiracy againgt the
safety of the state or the stability of the govern-
ment, and the courts provisionally dismissed the in-
dictments and ordered the liberation of the pris-
oners.
Far from discouraging them, the temporary sac-
rifice of their liberty only served to stimulate the
leaders of the Colored Party to continue the
struggle. The movement soon received the support
of the overwhelming majority of the colored peo-
ple throughout the country. Pressed by the public
opinion of the white population which saw in the
movement of Estenoz not a simple vindication of
the natural righứs of a despoiled people, but an as-
sault upon the traditional prerogatives of white sua
premacy by divine right, the government secured
the enactment of a law which ended the lawful ex-
istence of the Independent Colored Party.
The author of this law was a colored man, Mar-
tin Morua Delgado, a man of uncommon erudition
and enlightenment with regard to everything ex-

It is difficult to justify, in the light of clear rea-
son, the action of Morua Delgado. Those who
think superficially and are carried away with high-
sounding phrases will say that Morua considered
himself as a citizen of Cuba and not as black
man. But those who look beneath the surface in
the penetrating quest of truth will say that thai
otherwise brilliant man was so blinded by selfish-
ness that he could not see that while he could live
as a citizen, thousands of his brothers lived as
pariahs; or he feared the prospect of the ascend-
ancy of the leader of the Independent colored
Party and was willing to endanger the future of
his race in order to maintain his own position
against the growing power and influence of another
man of color.
But, whatever may have been the motives uf
Senator Morua in introducing and sponsoring a
bill which prohibited the formation of political
parties composed exclusively of avowed members of
one race, the fact is that, once in force, this law

Colored Party to a disastrous revolution. Martin
Morua Delgado, as a colored man, never should
have been the author of such a law. It would have
come sooner or later, but the idea and its execu-
tion should have been left to be conceived by white
members of the Congress.
The Morua Law, a denial of the right of associa-
tion inherent in all free human beings, was natural-
ly and inevitably answered by a last, but rather
premature, resort to arms. In 1912, the leaders
of the prohibited Independent Colored Party gath-
ered their followers for an armed protest which
was heralded throughout the Island and abroad as a
general uprising of the black Cubans against the
white population. But the Independent Colored
Party, it may be solemnly affirmed, never contem-
plated a rebellion against the white people. The
Party and its adherents rebelled only and exclusive-
ly against the Morua Law, which had destroyed a
political organization devoted to peaceful and just
objectives.
With the revolution in progress, it was inevitable
that the white people, within and without the coun-
try, should form an opinion adverse to the causes

political servitude to which they were subjected.
All the bitterness, all the hatred, all the ancestral
prejudices of the white race against the black, were
let loose. While the machine guns of the govern-
.
ment troops were mowing down thousands of col-
ored men, not alone those in arms, but the peace-
ful inhabitants of towns and villages in the East-
ern Prorince of Cuba, in the larger cities and even
in the Capital of the Republic, white men armed
to the teeth went about ordering any and every
black man to withdraw from the streets and public
places on pain of death, and the mere color of his
skin was sufficient reason to send a man to prison
on the charge of rebellion.
The number of colored men who perished in the
shortlived and unhappy revolution of 1912 is es-
timated at five thousand. Among them was the
leader, Estenoz, who, having responded to an in-
vitation to confer with the forces of the govern-
ment on the terms of surrender and the restoration
of order, was subjected to the penalty of the Ley de
Fuga, or Law of Flight, which is a favorite

to blot out the resentment of the white people

Then began for the black Cubans a new period
of trials and privation. Soldiers who had fought
loyally under the banner of the Republic in the
late revolution were expelled from the army. Pub-
lic officials, even in the most humble capacity, were
removed from their positions because of their col-

hunger. The rewards which the race had achieved
for their devotion to the common cause of the Na-

increase those rewards by force.
The black people of the United States have far
more ground for discontent and complaint than

F in countries like Cuba the existence of the
black race as a unit distinct from the white
race is impossible because of prohibitory laws, the
United States, on the other hand, offer a splendid
field for the beneficient action of the black people
as a distinct collectivity, because the laws and
customs of this country, far from inhibiting the
separatist aspirations of the colored population,
tend to promote them. A proper appreciation of
these circumstances should disclose to the colored
people opportunities which they have apparently
failed to utilize for the advantage of the race.
In the district of Harlem, for instance, which
comprises most of the large colored population of
New York City, there is no political party com-
posed of members of the race. Such a party, prop-
erly organized and efficiently directed, could exert
an appreciable influence in the interest of the race
by throwing ite strength, at the opportune moment,
to one or other of the dominant parties. Such co-
operation does not imply permanent attachment or
fusion, which would be tantamount to dissolution.
A virile political party, composed of colored citi-

electoral contests, only to the party which gave the

With a strong party, independent in its organ-

vantage with the dominant parties, the colored peo
ple of the United States would be a very much
more weighty factor in politics than they are at
present. Indeed, it is difficult to understand why
such a party, working in the interest of the race,
has not been organized. This anomaly cannot be
attributed to the hatred and prejudice of the
whites, because they themselves have insisted on
absolute separation as the basic principle of their
relations with the black race, and it cannot be pre-
sumed that they would oppose the application of
this principle to the field of politics, while en-
forcing it in all the other activities of life which
are inextricably associated with the political rights
and duties of free citizens. Nor is it to be feared
that, in order to prevent the colored population
from intelligently exercising their political rights
for the collective well being and not for selfish, in-

First of all, there is among these people an unde-

lions of potential members of such an organiza-
tion; thirdly, the isolation and non-interference of
the white race with regard to the colored race at
once justify and facilitate the formation of a col-

party is not due to a lack of intelligence to con-
ceive, capacity to organize, ability to direct, will-
ingness to co-operate. All these requisites are to
be found in plenty among black Americans. The
only thing needful is the will. Once this is creat-
ed, it will rapidly be converted into action.
There is nothing Utopian, nothing chimerical, in
the ideas here expressed. Twenty years ago, ten

these are an improvement on the conditions of a

N the preceding chapter we have discussed the
need of a national organization of the colored
people for the recognition of the race as an element
of strength and usefulness within the territory of
the Union Black Americans have fully sensed
and have sought to satisfy this need, but their or-
ganized efforts have been generally misdirected and
totally ineffective. Especially is this true of an
association of black people who aspire to bring
about the wholesale migration of the race to Africa.
The impelling idea of the partisans of this move
ment, while it does not find the support of the gen-
eral mass of colored population, certainly arouses
their comment; and comment, whether with regard
to the activities of peoples or the life of individu-
als, is always the consequence of some interest.
The African migration scheme and its associated
ideas constitute an important feature of the group
interests of black Americans and, as such, are
worthy of consideration wholly without regard to
the mental capacity of the leaders of this move
ment.

mote the reunion of the race on African soil ? We
are told that this gathering will create a civilized
African State able to make itself felt as a power
among the nations. But, for the realization of this
purpose, it is surely not necessary for all black
people to go to Africa, carried away with the as-
sumption that that continent is our geographic
fatherland.
The concept of nationality is based not so much
on geographical boundaries as on sentiments of
association, of community of interest, sentiments
of far greater weight in the mind of the individual
than the laws governing the acquisition of a new
citizenship. Assuming that the go-to-Africa move-
ment succeeded and that millions of civilized black
people went and hoisted on that continent the flag
of a new nation, their mission would have been
purely speculative but at best one of conquest and
dominion over the native population.
It is reasonably certain that no black man born
and bred on this side of the Atlantic knows what
it is to feel genuinely African, and it is doubtful
whether any black alien has even a superficial
sense of a common nationality with the African.

State possess the physical means to maintain itself

factor in the maintenance of a nation? The alien
element would not constitute the economic factor in
our all-black Africa State, for the black race, in or
outside of Africa, is not even moderately well off.

ably terminated by absorption, formal or effective,
by some richer nation.
The recognition of an African nation of extrane
ous conception and artificial foundation, would be
merely conventional and subject to the conditions
usually imposed on a State regarded as inferior.
And our African nation would be worse than back-
ward. It would be a backless nation. It would
not rest on the secure foundation of a civilization
and a culture peculiar to its people. There are civ-
a
ilized black people; there are cultured black men,
who have absorbed the civilization of the white race
and who may impart to their own race the culture
and civilization which they have acquired. But
these men are not sufficient in number and influ-
ence to mould a characteristic, definite African cul-
ture with elements derived from a civilization not
of African origin.
The time has certainly come for the black man,
wherever he may be, to enforce his claim for equal-

full recognition of the extent to which he has used
such opportunity in the work of civilization. If

LLUSTRATIVE at once of the real influence
of the go-to-Africa movement and of the black-
people's ability to appreciate and tolerate good,
high-priced humor, is the fact that no enthusiastic
inigrant, traveling at his own expense, has got any-
where nearer to Africa than the one hundred and
thirty-fifth highway running straight east and west
in New York. Along this route, some few are said
to be awaiting passage. One or two have crossea
the Atlantic Ocean at the expense of the crowd, but
they lost no time in recrossing to bring back the
newe that blackwater fever is no respecter of black
persons born outside of West Africa. And this is
about as much as the go-to-Africa association is
likely to accomplish for the creation of an enduring
nation of black people, respected and recognized
by all civilization. So far as black Americans are
concerned, their nation is within the boundaries of
the United States. If they must be independent,
they must find a sphere for the exercise of their
independence within the Union, for they are not go-

on which the law and politics depend, these com-

surrounding aggregations of white people. Reas-
sembled in some territory of sufficient extent, all
or most of these miniature nations of colored peo-
ple would constitute an important Black Nation
within a Wnite Nation, and its establishment
would be justified if it could be accomplished by
peaceful means and with the mutual consent of
both groups.
The nation within a nation has long been recog-
nized in the white man's International Law. Euro-
pean settlements in Chinese cities, in Turkey and
elsewhere in Asia, have for generations been inde-
pendent, in every practical sense, of the local and
national authority. In much the same way, the
Canal Zone, in the heart of the Republic of Pana-
ma, is entirely free, so far as the authority of the
Isthmian Republic is concerned. The United
States pays rent for the occupancy of the Canal
Zone, thereby acquiring the right to fortify this
territory against its Panamanian owners.
The ultimate formula for the definite constitu-
tion of a Black Nation within the United States is
of secondary importance as compared with the fact

that such a nation is recognized in principle by:
almost all the people of the country. The entry of
black people into a residential district occupied by
whites is followed, sometimes slowly but always
surely, by the withdrawal of the latter, who regard
as unholy the ground on which niggers tread.
There is never any question as to the impossibility
of members of the two races occupying the same
building, the same street, the same section of the
city. No matter how much they would like to re-
main, the whites must abandon their homes to the
blacks, as it would be harder even to kill them off
than to live near them.

To white New York, no less than to foreigners
of more distant origin, Harlem is reputed to
be a good place to keep away from. For Harlem
is the name of the most compact and most thickly
populated settlement of black people in the world.
This fact alone would be sufficient to make the rest
of New York quite foreign to Harlem. But, as
the world now thinks, a city of black people must
inevitably be a city of black deeds. So the fame of
New York's colored city has gone abroad, and it is
by no means an enviable fame.
An examination of police records would prob-
ably show that there is no greater percentage of
crimes and criminals in the colored district of New
York than in any similar section of the Ameri-

there is less crime in black New York than in some
other sections of the city, inhabited by peoples of
the same general economic and intellectual plane,
but of a lower degree of pigmentation. But what
is certain is that newspaper reports of the unusual
doings of malefactors can give no idea of the usual
doings of more than one hundred thousand law-
abiding and industrious colored residents grouped
in one section of the city of New York. To know

To the stranger expecting to find the typical
kennels of the underdog, such as the hovels of the
poor which disgrace many a European city, the na-
tive quarters in South Africa, or the old Chinatown
in Havana, the colored section of New York is an
agreeable revelation. Externally, it is far more
attractive than some of the other parts of the city.
Streets as clean as any are lined with buildings
newer and better constructed than the flats and
apartment houses in many other sections of the
city. Private houses compare favorably with
homes in some of the exclusive residential dis-
tricte. In many instances, the interior may show
evidence of a lack of adequate economic and cul-
tural preparation of the occupants. There is some
crowding and discomfort in the flats and apart-
ments. But many of these, as well as some of the
private residences, are furnished and maintained
with a luxury indicative of economic ease and of
a thorough appreciation of the fine art of living.

ters. Among the many admirable paintings was a
canvas representing Christ washing the feet of the
disciples, which, it is said, was awarded a first prize
in the Paris Salon. One section of the exhibition
was devoted to embroidery; another to African
handicraft, showing cloths, iron implements and
other useful objects produced by the natives. The

rious languages, patiently collected by two colored
gentlemen whose hobby is to gather from all parts-
of the world books written by or relating to mem-
bers of their race, and whose modesty forbids the
disclosure of their names, for fear that they may
receive the unsought recognition of their unique
service to the cause of human understanding.
It is said that this exhibition will be held an-
nually. In time it may be held permanently. This
and similar efforts, in all lines of activity, are typi-
cal of the better elements among the colored people
of Harlem. And the better are far more numerous
than the worse. What these people are doing in
New York, they can do and are doing, sometimes
with even greater success, in other cities. If they
enjoyed everywhere the same freedom from inter-
ference, the same guaranties of life and property,
the same opportunities to utilize for their own de-
velopment the educational facilities afforded to all
other elements in the community, as they do in
New York, the colored people of the United States
would do their full share of the work of civiliza-
tion, whether the City within a City reached its
logical conclusion in the Nation within a Nation,
or by its sheer merits disproved the need for its:
existence.

THE COLOR QUESTION
а
OF
F the many hopeful aspects of the color ques-
tion in the United States, not the least strik
ing is the absence of a visible color line within the
Afro-American group itself. Democracy, balked
and thwarted in every attempt to exert its leveling
influence against the rigid barrier between the
white race and the colored, finds a generous mea-
sure of compensation in the success of its on-
slaughts against the strongholds of lineage and
complexion in one group and the other. The color
question in the United States, difficult of solution,
cruel and reactionary as it is in so many of its
manifestations, neverthelese represents a long step
in the progress of civilization. For, after all, there
is only one color question in the United States,
whereas there might be two or three or half a doz-
en, each as troublesome as the others put together.
The colored population of this country is a so-
cial unit, not only in the broader sense of com-
munity life, but in the more intimate relations of
man to man. Between the American of the color
of ebony and the perfectly white man of African
descent, there is nothing to suggest that the former
considers himself superior because of the purity of
his African blood, nor that the latter finds superi-
ority in the scanty pigmentation of his skin. One

intermediate types of this kaleidoscopic people.
The other Americans, of pure European descent,
are so blinded by prejudice that they only see black
when contemplating their fellow citizens of African
descent. The latter, with their characteristic adap-
tiveness, readily suppress the claims, though the
evidence cannot be suppressed, of a composite and
extremely varied ethnic origin. Striving and look-
ing forward to the recognition of the oneness of the
human race, they do not turn back to re-establish
original lines of cleavage.
Not only by the orthodox whites, but aloo by the
orthodox blacks, some of the mixed people are of-
ten accused of what is regarded as the heinous
crime of “trying to get away from their race" or of
"passing for white." As a matter of fact, it is
surprising how few of those who, by every physical
standard ought to be classed as "white people," do
avail themselves of the opportunity of severing
their connection with the despised black race. Ra-
cial distinction in the United States, rigid as it is
when visible and real, does not require that citi-
zens be labeled in order to give them a classification
which nature did not establish. Custom forbids
the contact of "white" people with "colored” peo-

ple in intimate social relationship. But no one has
any moral obligation to deny himself the opportun-
ity afforded by his physical and mental qualities to
earn an honest living, because of any false sense
of respect for friends or pride of ancestry. How-
ever, most of those Afro-Americans who might be
altogether "white" prefer to be "colored” people
and some of them seem to enjoy being negroes.
But there can be no doubt that the sacrifice is often
more apparent than real, for not a little of what
passes for greatness among the weak would be
recognized as mediocrity among the strong.
Democracy, the ideal for the attainment of
which the soul of mankind is constantly striving,
like all virtues is subject to conversion into vice.
The Afro-American has established in his own
realm the equality of men without regard to their
external inequalities. It is but human that equal-
ity of physical manhood should be mistaken for
equality in things spiritual and intellectual. In a
thorough-going democracy everybody must be an
aristocrat. White America is not such a democ-
racy, either in itself or in relation to other peoples
and especially to black America. If it were, it
could not occupy the place that it now holds with
good title, despite its many and grave defects, in

mocracy is thorough-going; too much so for its own
good.
Where everybody thinks himself the equal of
anybody else, nobody is willing to be guided by the
counsels of another. In such a community, there
can be no leader, because there are no followers.
There can be no efficient organization for the gen-
eral guod, for every organizer must be inspired and
dominated by essentially selfish aims. Worthwhile
ideas there may be, but the duplication of effort in
realizing them must inevitably lead to a less-
ening or destruction of the effect. The Afro-Amer-
ican, fighting against color and caste discrimina-
tion from without, cannot afford to give it a place
in his own mind and in his own conduct. But if
he would remove it from the mind and heart of
others, he must recognize his own individual lim-
itations. He must suppress the envy and jealousy

which impel him at all times and in all lines of
activity, to attempt to do what his fellow may bet-

calls for the self-assertion of the individual in the

it is so zealous for its own conservation that it de

THE COLOR QUESTION
IN
N contrast with the sentiment of group unity
among North Americans of African blood,
this ethnic strain does not constitute a unified peo-
ple in the Latin American countries, least of all in
Cuba. Between the pure blacks, the brown mulat-
toes and the yellow-white quadroons, there exist
almost impassable social barriers. The black man
regards the man of mixed African and European
blood as a natural enemy, while the mixed man
looked upon his black half-brother in much the
same way as Anglo-Saxon society regards the so-
called natural child, with the difference that, for
the Cuban mulatto, the black brother is altogether
unnatural.
Of course, there could be no rule without ex-
ceptions. The barriers are sometimes removed, not
only in the ordinary relations of individuals, but
by marriage. And then, if the children happen,
as is likely, to vary greatly in color, they establish
their social connections accordingly. It is a mat-
ter of fact that in a Cuban family, consisting of
black children by a first mariage and mulattoes by
a second marriage of the same mother, the differ-
ence of color made it impossible for members of
both broods to attend a social function together.
Especially in Santiago de Cuba, the blacks, the

mulattoes and the quadroons have their separate
clubs and social institutions, and they do not ex-
change invitations.
This exclusiveness, it must be noted, by no
means implies the existence among Afro-Cubans of
an instinctive and inexorable caste system which
might be interpreted as justifying and strengthen-
ing the Anglo-American laws, written and un-
written, on racial distinction. The hierarchy of
color in Cuba was established as a part of Spanish
colonial policy. The aristocratic landowners did,
perhaps, adopt a more humane and natural at-
titude towards their children by enslaved moth
ers than did the planters of the southern United
States. But the consequent differentiation between
the partly and the wholly black people of Cuba was
further stimulated as a means of continuing their
exploitation for the safety and profit of the com-
mon master. With the development of the struggle
for independence, the Spanish government saw to
it that grandee and commoner, white and black and
yellow and brown, were kept as far apart as pos-
sible. But most of them got together on the side
of Free Cuba. And Cuba believes that the surest
way to maintain her freedom is to have three or
four color question, which neutralize each other.

Pride of kind is a very estimable quality in
itself and for those who possess it, but its practical
value, in relation to others, depends upon the nu-
merical and economic strength of those who share
the game pride of class or race. In Cuba, the
white people outnumber all others and are even
disproportionately strong in wealth and education,
while the pure blacks are lowest in numbers and
in influence. They may feel as proud as the whites
of their purity of race and color, but they cannot
escape the cumulative effect of the pride and preju-
dice of all the other elements of the population.
They cannot fail to be impressed with the utter
hopelessness of attempting to rise, with their color,
above the position which tradition accords them in
the community. In common with the mixed peo-
ple, they must believe that successful achievement
in the work of civilization is conditioned upon the
possession of a more or less white skin. In Cuba
the black man may comfort himself with pride in
his color. But so long as everybody else believes
that the black color is a disgrace and an evidence
of mental incapacity, there can be little effort, and
that doomed to failure, for the development of a
racial pride based on the useful accomplishmente
of men of African blood.

The black people of Cuba were separated from
their blood brothers of lighter hue in order that
Spain might rule. Tradition maintains that di-
vision in order to facilitate and ensure the rule
of the white people. But there is no danger that a
white majority greater than that of South Caro-
lina and others of the United States would cease
to rule in Cuba if the mulattoes and the blacks de-
veloped a spirit of mutual respect and tolerance
which would enable them to co-operate effertively
for their common welfare and, therefore, for the
advantage of all the people of the Island Republic.
No matter how much "white" blood they may
have in their veins, the mixed people are not re-
garded as of the white race. No matter how little
"black" blood they may have, it is an element which
they have in common with the black people. In the
strictly physical sense of the word, the partly white
cannot be of the same race as the wholly black.
But they can form and ought to form a racial unit
a
for the development and maintenence of a self-
sustaining civilization able to command from oth-
ers the respect which it should accord to itself.

THE COLOR QUESTION
DESPITE the persistence of the traditional dis-
tinction between the various types of mulat-
toes and the pure black people of Cuba, there is a
marked tendency among the representative ele
ments of all these divergent groups to get into closer
contact for the promotion of their common welfare.
Following the ill-fated revolution of Estenoz,
the various sections of the colored race began to
perceive that they could not expect to mitigate the
prejudice and discrimination which they suffered
alike from the whites, while they continued to
practice the same evils among themselves. Espe-
cially in the smaller towns and villages, where the
scantier the colored population the keener were the
lines of caste which separated them, the blacks and
the mulattoes have come to associate more freely,
not alone for the pursuit of objects which they
recognize as of their common interest, but also in
the more intimate sense of personal friendliness.
In the larger cities this wholesome tendency is
still more in evidence. The small, exclusive circles
composed of people possessing as nearly as possible
the same degree of skin coloration, have been ex-
panding, not only in their composition but also as
regards their activities. A typical product of the
new spirit is the club “Atenas” in the city of Ha-

vana. This is an organization which comprises in
its active membership men and women of all shades
of the colored race and counts as honorary members
many white persons of the highest distinction.
“Atenas” is, as its name implies, a cultural cen-
ter for the colored people of Cuba. Its activities
are social in the fullest sense of the word. Its club
rooms afford not only recreation and entertainment
in the limited manner characteristic of such insti-
tutions, but also are opened for lectures, concerts
and other manifestations of intellectual activity.
With these efforts and through the medium of its
monthly illustrated magazine, “Atenas” reveals to
the colored people their own possibilities when they
are willing to co-operate for their common wel-
fare. At the same time, without making abstract
and objective demands for political and other
rights or advantages, it exerts a powerful influence
in securing the respect and consideration of the
best elements of white people.
Not with a sense of condescension, but with a
feeling of ease and genuine appreciation of the
opportunity to meet people of a different group but
of their own intellectual and moral level, white
friends attend, on invitation, the entertainments of
“Atenas.” Not long ago the club held a brilliant

ter and generous friend of the colored race-a lady
who frequently visits this country, where she en-
joys a large acquaintance. This reception was at:
tended by many persons of the highest standing in
public affairs and in the various spheres of the
arts.
Occasions such as this mark the beginning of a
new epoch in the relations of white and colored
people in Cuba. In that Island, as in the rest of
the Latin countries, there is nothing extraordinary
in the meeting of people of pure European lineage
with persons uf mixed race at private or public
gatherings. But in such cases the mixed people are
admitted not only as a necessary recognition of
their standing in the community, but because of
their partly European origin. The genuineness of
their welcome depends on the extent of their physi-
cal affinity to the white people, which they them-
selves always seek to regard as complete.
On the other hand, "Atenas” represents the ef-
fort of people who find in their non-European an-
cestry the principal motive for contact and co-oper-
ation. The fair mulatto is no longer ashamed of
his African blood. The

or, for uniformity of complexion has ceased to be
the indispensable basis for the constitution of a
race or people. The white friends, and those who
are not friends of “Atenas” can now see the pos-
sibility of the parallel development and neighbor-
ly existence of two groups of people, each respect-
ing the other as well as itself, without a thought of
the absorption or asphyxiation of one by the other.
The influence of this club is making itself felt
throughout the Island of Cuba, and similar or-
ganizations are springing up in the smaller cities
of the various Provinces. · Ultimately, the colored
.
people, by suppressing their own prejudices and
showing that they can develop worthwhile institu-
tions of their own, will achieve the equality which
they could not obtain by force.

THE
HE United States is unquestionably a demo-
cratic country, if by democracy is meant the
frankness of manner and simplicity of living of
its people. But the democracy of the United States
is not comprehensive of all the people; its applica-
tion is limited to specific groups of the population,
characterized by affinity or identity of ethnic orig-
in, of religion, of language, of customs. The spir-
it of tolerance and mutual respect among the mem-
bers of one group is converted into a feeling of dis-
respect and hostility when applied to members of
another group. The play of these hostile forces
one upon the other serves as a restraining influ-
ence upon them all and produces as regarde most of
them an external atmosphere of harmony and at
times, or cordiality. But this system of democracy
has not yet been extended to include white and colo
ored people. Between these two major groups there
still remains in all its strength and inflexibility the
dividing line which separates autocracy and privi-
lege from dependency and exploitation.
Throughout the civilized world the United States
is regarded as the symbol of democracy. This
opinion is well founded if we consider the guiding
principles of the political institutions of the coun-
try, the examples of men of humble birth who

tivities of the nation and in the opinion of its peo-
ple. But as compared with the France that de-
stroyed the Bastille and proclaimed the Rights of
Man, the France that accords those rights to the
black man as to all others, the country of Roose-
velt is superior to the land of Victor Hugo only if
the superficial is more important than the funda-
mental in the structure of a democratic people. A
real democracy must be built up on the principles
of equity summarized by Jose Marti in his cam-
paign for the Independence of Cuba, "a Repub-
lic cordial with all and for all. " Such a nation
was what the great restorer of the American Na-
tion had in mind when he expressed the hope that
the governnient and people of this country would,
like himself, be animated and inspired "with jus-
tice to all, with malice toward none."
The people and the public powers of the United
States have fallen far short of the ideal of Lin-
coln, not only in the relations of the various groups
of the population, but especially as regards the
attitude of the white man toward the black man.
Democracy may subsist without intimate fellow-
ship among those who share it, but it ceases to be
real when one section of the people abuse their pow-

er in denying to members of a weaker section the
most elementary claims of justice. So long as there
exists a popular tendency among the white people
of the United States to commit crime under pre-
text of punishing the perpetrators of other crimes;
so long as the responsible and thinking elements of
the population, including the executive and legis-
lative powers, do not take steps for the effective
suppression of Lynch Law, the United States will
not have earned the place which, in many other
respecte, it so richly deserves, among the leading
forces of human progress.
A great democracy cannot be constituted mere-
ly by the declaration of certain fundamental prin-
ciples which are thereafter violated with impunity.
It is not enough for the basic law of the land to
set forth the equality of citizens, if in practice the
rights accruing therefrom are systematically and
persistently abridged or denied to certain citizens.
Democracy can hardly be said to have progressed
when women are granted the right of suffrage,
while this right is openly and admittedly taken
from men to whom it had been granted because
they had made themselves entitled to it.
A nation that deprives its own citizens of their
rights is not likely to have much genuine respect

for the rights of other nations. A great democracy
must not only be a democracy at heart for and to
all those whom it comprises, but it must apply the
same principles in its relations with other nations.
A strong democratic state must respect and seek to
preserve rather than to destroy the liberty of weak
er peoples. No matter what is said to the contrary,
and there is much truth that may be said, the
United States of America have by no means lived
up to their professed abhorrence of autocracy and
aggressive imperialism in their international af-
fairs.
Nations which possess great material resources
and materialized wealth do not tend to be truly
democratic. As with wealthy individuals, their
economic power is accompanied with a proportional
haughtiness and pride and with progressively clear-
er expressions of autocracy. The United States
is at present the wealthiest country in the world.
Consequently, it is the most autocratic country, de
spite the existence, in some quarters, of a current
of opinion which is as yet too weak to make itself
felt to any appreciable extent. May the tide grow
until the democracy of the United States embraces
all its citizens in the application of equal justice
before the law and in the mind of the people, upon
whose will depends the enforcement of the law.

Spanish America, although his family his-

may bring to a man a greater measure of respect
and consideration for his person than would be the
case in the United States, and class and individual
distinctions are perhaps more marked in the form-
er colonies of aristocratic Spain than in the re-
publican descendant of England, yet it cannot be
said with truth, as it often is affirmed on insuffi-

and as it is difficult for a moneyed country to be

The Latin American peoples are essentially and

racy, which the people are always ready and de-
termined to maintain unabridged. Contrary to
the accepted opinion in other countries, the fre-
quent revolutions in some of the Latin American
countries are not necessarily harmful, for while
they may temporarily interfere with the economic
activity, they tend to ensure the political and moral
integrity of the nation.
With rare exceptions, revolutions are not start-
ed to promote, but rather to counteract, personal
ambitions. The attempt to overthrow a govern-
ment is seldom inspired in the slightest degree by
selfish motives, but rather by the determination to
restore to the people the rights of which they are
being progressively deprived by men who, having
got into power by lawful means and in obedience to
the public will, have failed to resist the temptation
to extend their powers or the duration of office,
sometimes for their personal advantage, sometimes
in the sincere belief that they are the best and only
qualified to manage the affairs of the state, but al-
ways obeying the dictate of unbridled egoism.
A typical illustration of the motive factors in a
Latin American revolution is the following. A

didate for president, by peaceful means and in ac-
cordance with constitutional procedure. When his
term is drawing to a close, the president aspires to
re-election, which, in the Latin American coun-
tries, is regarded as a principle of autocracy and is
prohibited either by the letter of the law or the
spirit of the people. But the retiring president and
his associates or advisers avail themselves of the
whole machinery of the government, including the
army as a last resort, to coerce the people and pre-
vent a free election. The leaders of the opposition
are imprisoned; newspapers which venture to criti-
cize the government are suppressed; the constitu-
tional guaranties of the liberty of the citizens are
suspended; and the president is re-elected.
This is a situation which many a Latin Ameri-
can country has been called upon to face. The ulti-
mate remedy, no doubt, is education or occupation,
not by alien authorities, but of the mind and hand
of the native masses. Meantime, must an outraged
people bow in supine resignation to the will of the
usurper? Not while virile men are free and de-

which they are aimed are always right. Having as-
sumed the role of big brother to the contentious
small boys or creeping infants to the South, the
Great Republic of North America has of recent
years declared war on revolution by imposing on
offending countries the penalty of non-recognition
of a government empowered by revolution or, when
practicable, by itself directly assuming the suc-
cession of the government which has been over--
thrown. Revolutions have lately been on the de-
crease in Latin America, but autocracy, native or
foreign, has had proportionately more opportun-
ity to destroy the results of a century of struggle
for the maintenance of democratic government, in
theory and practice.
An intelligent and helpful interest on the pari
of the United States with regard to the political
affairs of the Latin American countries would not
be based on the policy at present pursued by the
Washington government. The government and
people of the United States must understand that
revolution is not an unmixed evil, and that every
guch occurrence must be judged impartially and
with a full knowledge of the facts by any foreign
power which proposes to further, and not to hind-
er, the progress of democracy in the Latin Ameri-.
can countries.

FROM earliest childhood the Anglo-American
woman enjoys a freedom of expression un-
known to her Spanish-American sister. In the
United States, the education of women, while it
aims to conserve feminine charm and idealism, al-
lows the fullest opportunity for the development
and utilization of the talents of women in the ma-
terial, practical spheres of life. The woman of the
United States appreciates the spiritual value of
familiarity with the plays of Shakespeare and the
music of Verdi, but she also appreciates the value
of the dollar which she has earned with her own
brain and hand. She can discuss the subtleties of
philosophy and religion while she plies her knit-
ting in the subway. With her sex the world over,
she shares the ideals of home and family, but she
realizes that in order to have an ideal home and
family, she must be willing and prepared when
called upon to assume responsibilities which, in
other countries, are borne exclusively and often
imperfectly by men.
Trained to a life of activity, the American
woman, on the completion of her education, ceases
to be an economic burden on her parents. When
she marries, her actual or potential contribution
to the maintenance of the home places her in a po-

sition of equality with her husband. She is the
partner and associate of the master of the house-
hold, rather than his mistress or slave. She is
the companion whose counsel is sought and wel-
comed, not the dependent who obeys and dares not
speak. Maintaining and asserting her personality
no less in the home than in the office, the studio or
the factory, she is a positive factor in the progress
of her country.
Entirely different is the position of woman in
Spanish America. Brought up in an atmosphere
of seclusion and mysticism, the women of the high-
er classes usually begin their education with the
study of Christian doctrine, with special emphasis
on the lives of the saints, and end it with a course
in languages and piano playing, at which many of
them become expert. The women of the poorer
classes, unable to attend the convent, imbibe as
much as they can of feminine ideals or ideal fem-
ininity from their more favored sisters. Among
rich and poor alike, the paramount service and
duty of woman to society is to become as early as
possible an obedient wife and as often as possible
thereafter a fond and solicitous mother.
Without discarding these ideals, within recent
years the Spanish American woman has been en-
joying greater personal liberty and wider oppor-
tunity for the development of her abilities. In

many of the Latin countries, women now attend
the universities and professional schools on the
same terms ae men. Before marriage they occupy
clerical positions and practise professions hither-
to the exclusive perquisite of men.
After marry-
ing, they utilize their training to help their hus-
bands maintain and increase the conjugal estate.
If they have wealth and leisure, their social and
altruistic activities no longer center exclusively
about the church, but extend to the more general
questions of public interest.
This change in the position of woman in Latin
America is, of course, slow and, in some coun-
tries, hardly appreciable. The modern woman
meets with much opposition, not only from the
men, but from within the ranks of her own sex.
It cannot be denied, however, that the most pro-
gressive countries are those which, without per-
mitting woman to participate actively in the af-
fairs of the State, at least do not unduly hamper
her in the development and exercise of her talents
wherever she can unquestionably exert a benefi-
cent influence on the community. The new woman
in South America is largely a product of the in-
creasing contact between that region and North
America. She is one product of definite, indis-
putable value, and her growing popularity can
never be seriously affected by competition.

O the foreign sojourner in the United States,
one of the most striking peculiarities of the
people of this country is the multiplicity of religi-
ous sects and secret societies. Although, as previous-
ly stated, the observations of the writer of these
notes have been in large measure confined to the
colored people, it is quite true that, in the matter
of secret societies as in the other characteristics
of their civilization, the colored people merely re
flect the habits and customs of their white coun-
trymen.
Thc writer's earliest impression of the freedom
of worship in the United States was produced by
the spectacle of the members of a sect marching
through the streets of Harlem to or from their
temple, two abreast, each carrying a copy of their
prayer-book, all dressed alike in flowing blue
robes, the masculine element being particularly
distinguished by wearing the hair and beard as
long as nature allows. On inquiry as to the iden-
tity of these remarkable persons, no definite in-
formation could be obtained; according to some
informers, the gentlemen and ladies of the Sacred
Order of the Blue Gown are black Jews who, like
their white co-religionists, manage to keep alive
their customs in a land of absolute liberty and

a South American country, if they were not m
lested by police agents detailed constantly to in
vestigate their rites, they surely would be forced
to disband if they did not want to convert their
procession into a free circug. But an exhibition
that would draw out the whole population of a
South American town is so commonplace that it
hardly arrests a glance in New York.
Perhaps in no other country, civilized or sav-
age, are there so many secret organizations as in
the United States, and certainly there is none
where secrecy is so ostentatious. Hedge about
with mystery the most significant acts and you
have at once the nucleus of an association for
some glorious object. But be sure to give half the
secret away by displaying in public, in the sum-
mer or at other suitable times, the insignia of the
order. The American secret society is, like the
secret police, always ready to lose its secrecy by
showing a button or badge.

THE COLOR QUESTION
of the organizations of this character in
ted States are to be found in Europe and
in America, but not on the streets. The Ma-
the Odd Fellows, the Knights of Columbus,
Shriners in the United States are so overburd-
d with their secrets that they share them pe-
odically with the public by parading in their
regalia. One society calls attention to its secrecy
by allowing its members to display an emblem rep-
resenting in its upper portion a sort of gong and
in the lower part the head and antlers of a deer.
The type of a really secret society is probably
best represented by the Ku Klux Klan, but even
this organization enfolds most of its secrecy in the
white sheet which its members wear in their pub-
lic performances. The activity of this society is
largely confined to the southern states and con-
sists, besides the parades, of the exploitation of al-
ready thoroughly established and recognized preju-
dices of color and religion. The Ku Klux Klan
has been accused, apparently with ample founda-
tion, of perpetrating, under cover of the white
sheete, the most barbarous and inhuman acts not
only against colored people, but also against the
other objects of the organization's displeasure. As

siders their connection with it, not even by show-
ing their faces when on parade or when torturing
a victim, the secrecy of the society is so complete
that it has been impossible to suppress the organ-
ization or to discover and bring to justice those
of its members who may have been guilty of deeds
unworthy of civilized men.
Happily, the activities of the other secret so-
cieties, as regards the general public, are usually
limited to the display of their regalia. With rare
exceptions, they do not seek to exercise any collec-
tive influence on general social and political ques-
tions. They do not undertake to regulate the pri-
vate conduct, either of outsiders or of their own
members. The American secret society merely re-
sponds to the demand of normal human beings for
fellowship and friendship, and the desire to pene-
trate the specious mysteries of a fraternal organ-
ization furnishes the occasion for contacts and as-
sociations which would otherwise be difficult of
realization among a people who are by training
reserved and individualistic.
