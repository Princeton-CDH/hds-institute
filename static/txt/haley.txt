AN 
 
 EPISTLE 
 
 To juftifie the 
 
 LADY NEWCASTLE, 
 
 • AND 
 
 Truth againft faUhood, laying thofe falfe, and 
 malicious afpeffions of her, that (he was 
 
 not Authour of her Books. 
 
 Would willingly begin with the common , and Dun- 
 fiable rode cfEpifiles, Gentle Readers, but finding 
 you much otherwise , I will fall to our difcourfe in 
 hand. Firfi’tis but your envious Suppofition that 
 this Lady mufi have converfi with many S cholers of 
 all kindes in learning,when ’ tis well known the con- 
 trary that jhe never converfi with any profefi Shooler in learning , 
 for to learn, neither did jhe need it , fence jhe had the converfation of 
 her Honor able 0 and mofi learned Brother from her cradle^and fence jhe 
 was married , with my worthy and learned Brother ; and for my felf 
 l have lived in the great world a great while , and have thought of 
 what has been brought to me by the jenfes, more then was put into me by 
 learned difcourfe j for l do not love to be led by the nof by Autho- 
 rity and old Authours, ipfe dixit will not ferve my turn, 
 were Ariftotle made a more Philofophical Bible then he is, 
 and allfcholers to have a lively faith in him, doth not move me to 
 be of their Philofophical churche at all. And l ajjure you her 
 converfation with her Brother, and Brother-in-law, were enough 
 without a miracle or an impofsibility to get the language of the arts, 
 and learned profefi’ions, which are their terms, without taking any 
 degrees in Schooles. It is not fo difficult a thing though they make 
 mountains of mole-hills, & fay they,thatthis Lady ufeth many termes of

the Schoohs -, but truly fhe did never- Impe her high-flying Pkan- 
 cies, with any old broken F ethers out of any univerfityy and if you 
 read ml l, which is to under fland,and look on her Poems, you will finde 
 they are all new born Phanfies , never toucht of heretofore. But for 
 the rarity of the terms, or nefis of Divines , Philofophers, Pkyfici- 
 ans, Geometricians, Ajlrono mers, and the ref of the (f own-Tnbe, at 
 one te arms them, how is it poflible fhe fhould know them •, And firfi 
 for Divinity, when jhe [peaks of Predeflination, Free-will , Tranfub- 
 fiantiation,and confubftantiation 5 truly tbefe termes are not [0 hard to 
 begot by heart as to be underflood, fince / beleeve it puzzels the learned 
 to make fenfe of them. But / befeech you give this Lady [0 much ca- 
 pacity, as to get them by heart , fince every Tub-preacher difcourfes 
 of them, and every fanftified wife goffips them in wafers, and hipo - 
 cris at every Chrifiening. Next are the termes of the Philof ophers. 
 Certainly ’ tis no (fonjuration to conceive Atomes, invifible, and indi- 
 vifible bodies, elements, earth, air , water and f re, whereof your ele- 
 mentary fre under the moon is much doubted of, and then you have 
 but three elements. Motion is a difficult thing >indeed,to under fi and the 
 ^Pfirietes of it, but certainly not of a bodfmo'ved,that > s no fuch tranfcen* 
 dent thing.Dilation a fpreading, Contraction a gathering together Ra- 
 rificationthinning,andCondenfation thickning -,1 confejje in the La- 
 tine it feems very learned, but in the Englifh very vulgar , therefore 
 / befeech you give this Lady leave to have the. wit, and the judge- 
 ment to under fi and tbefe (fre at no my fieri es. And put the cafe now that 
 this Lady fhould name materia prima, and underfiand the Englifh 
 of it to be firfi matter, and ask her friend again what they mean by it, 
 and he tells her they fay they mean matter without form, and fhe fhould 
 anfwer, there is no matter without fome form, fo materia prima are 
 two Latine words that mean nothing. An incorporeal fubfiance is too 
 learned to be under flood, f 0 that is waved. Now for the termes of 
 Phyficians , when fhe [peaks of Choler, Phlegme, Melancholy and 
 Blood, and of Ventricles in the heart and brain, of veines, arteries 
 and nerves, and difcourfes of fevers, apoplexies, convulfions, Drop- 
 fies, and divers other difeafes with tbeir particular caufes,fymptoms 
 and cures ', how fhould this Lady underfiand thefe terms fay fome > 
 truly a good F armers wife in the country, by feeing one of her fheep 
 opened,may well underfiand the tear ms of mofi of thefe, and a Qonfia- 
 bles wife of a hundred in ElTex that ufeth Pbyfick and Surgery may 
 well talk of the difeafes, without any great learned my fiery , they are 
 fo plain andfo common, as none needsto confirue (jreek in Hippocra- 
 tes or Galen for them. But would you know how we know the great 
 My fiery of thefe Phyfical terms, I am almofi afhamed to tell you -, not 
 that we have been ever fickly, but by Melancholy often fuppofed our 
 felves to have fuch difeafes as we had not, and learned Phyfitians 
 were too wife to put us out of that humour , andfo thefe tearms cofl us 
 much more then they are Worth, and I hope there is no body fo malicious, 
 as to envie our bargain,neither truly do 1 repent my bargain,fince Phy- 
 fitians are the mofi rational men I have converfi with all, and my 
 worthy and very good friends, and truly this Lady never converfi with 
 
 h % any 
 


## p. (#8) ##################################################

any Phyfitian of any difeafe, but what [he thought fhe had her felf, 
 neither hath [he converjt with many of that profefion. Now for the 
 great learning of knowing the terms of Geometricians, when this La- 
 dy touches upon Triangles, Squares, (fircles. Diameters, Circumfe- 
 rences, (f enters, lines firaight and crooked &c. / will not difjeU thefe 
 great myfieries, hecaufe Wey are fc very common, as the meanejl under- 
 stands all thefe termes , even to Joyners and Carpenters, therefore fure- 
 ly this Lady is capable of them. 
 
 Then of A f rammers, f^y they , when [he f peak's of the Horizon, 
 Meridian, Equator, Zodiack,Eclyptick,Tropuks,Poles of the world &c. 
 when thefe termes are underload thats their meaning, they are no 
 fuch fubtilties, fince every boy may be taught them, with an apple for 
 the Globe, and the parings for the fphears, it is fo ridiculous then to 
 think that this Lady cannot underft and thefe te arms, as tit is rather 
 to be l aught at, then to trouble ones [elf to anfwer. And that invinci- 
 ble Problem, the quadrature of the circle , as they call it, which 
 makes me doubt that they think them [elves wifer, for naming the 
 quadrature , then fquaring the circle, wfo lives that hath not heard 
 of it , and who lives that can mt- do it, and who is dead that bathing 
 done it, and put the cafe it were done, what then ? why then ’ tis fqu'a- 
 red, and that's all, and that all is nothing, much ado about nothing. 
 But we will leave thefe impertinent, malicious, and mofi falfe ex- 
 ceptions to the Lady, and her Books, and will now begin with her 
 book of Poems, examining firfi her Philofophy there. Thats an old o- 
 pinion of Atomes,fay fome, witnejje Democrates and many others 5 
 Tis very true they have talkt of atomes, but did they ever difpofe of 
 them as they are there, or tell you what fever al forts there are erf them , 
 and what figure they bear, and being joyned, what forms 
 they produce of all kindes, in all things, if you have read any 
 fuch things before, tie be bold to burn the Book . why then 
 all thefe are new opinions, and grounded upon %eafon , I 
 fay fome, but they are Paradoxes , what then} I hope a Paradox 
 may be as true as an old opinion, and an old opinion as falfe as a 
 Paradox, for neither the one nor the other makes a truth , either the 
 new or the old, for what is mofl reafon (jf reafonable ; for in natural 
 Philofophy, one opinion may be as true as another, fince no body knows 
 the firfi caufe in nature of any thing. Then this Ladies Philofophy is 
 excellent, and will be thought fo hereafter , and the truth is that it 
 waswholy, and onely wrought out of her own brain, as there are many 
 witnefjes, bythefeveral jheets that [he [ent daily to be writ fair for 
 the prefje. As for her Poems, where are the exceptions to thefe > 
 marry they mi fie fometimes in the numbers and in the rimes. It is 
 well known by the copies, that thof e faults lie mofl upon the Corredor, 
 and the Printer fbut put the cafe there might be fome flips in that kinde, 
 is all the book damned for it, no mercy Gentlemen > when for the num- 
 bers, every Schoole-boy can make them on his fingers, and for %imes 
 Fenner would have put down Ben. Johnfon, and yet neither the boy 
 or Fenner fo good Poets. No, it is neither of thof e either makes, or 
 condemns a Poet, it is new born and err eating Phanfies that Glori-

fies a Poet , and in her Book of Poems , I am f ure there is excellent,and 
 new Phancies,as have not been writ, by any,and that it was onely writ by 
 her 'is thegreatefi truth in the world. Now for her Book called the 
 Worlds Oho, fay feme, how is it pofsible that fhe fhowld havefuch 
 experience , to write offuch things Jo $ I anfwer , that I living long 
 in the <reeat.tr or td) and having the various fortunes of what they call 
 good and bady certainly the reading of men might bring me to as 
 much experience as the reading of Books, and this I have now and 
 then difcourfi unto this Lady, who hath wifely and elegantly dr eft it 
 in her own way , and fumptuoufty ctoathed it, at the charge of her own 
 Phancies and exprefsions *, I fay fome of them floe hath heard from 
 me, but not the fortieth part of her book, all the reft are abfolutely her 
 own in all kindes, \ this is an ingenious truth, therefore beleeve it. 
 As for the Book of her Philofophical opinions, there is not any one thing 
 in the whole Book, that is not abf olutely [pun out by her own fiudious 
 phapcy, and ifyouwill lay by a little pafsion againji writers, you will 
 like it , and the beft, of any thing fhe has writ , therefore read it once 
 or twice, not with malice to finde a little fault, but with judgement 
 to like what is good. Truly / cannot beleeve f 9 unworthily of any Scho- 
 lar, honouring them fo much as we both do, that they fhould envie this 
 Lady, or fhould have f 9 much malice or emulation,to caft f uehfalfe af- 
 perfions on her, that fhe did not write thofe Books that go forth in her 
 name y they will hardly finde out who elfe writ them, and l protefi none 
 ever writ them but her f elfJTou fhould rather incourage her, then byfalfe 
 fuppofitions to let her fee the world is fo ill natured, as to beleeve faU 
 fhoods before truths. But here’s the crime, a Lady writes them,and to in- 
 trench fo much upon the male prerogative, is not to be forgiven^ but I 
 know Gown-men will be more civil to herfbecaufe fhe is of the fijown too , 
 and therefore I am confident you will defend her and truth, and thus be 
 undeceived. I had not troubled you with this, but that a learned 
 DoUor, our very noble friend, writes word of the infidelity of fome 
 people in this kinde-, whatfoever I have write js abfolutly truth, which 
 I here as a man cf Honour fet my hand to.

 TO THE 
 
 R E A D E R- 
 
 ]Tfmy Book called the worlds Olio, there are fuck 
 grojje mistakes in mifplacing of Chapters , and fo 
 many lifter all faults , as my look is much dif ad- 
 vantaged thereby. 
 
 As for Chapters, there are many mifplaced, for 
 fome Chapters that belong to that part of dtfeaf es, 
 are mi [placed among thofe of natural Thilofophy, 
 as one that belongs to fleep , and three Chapters that are of the temper 
 of Aire i likewise another Chapter of the ftrength of the foul and bo- 
 dy is placed between the firfl and l aft part of the Common-Wealth, which 
 nothing belongs to it: for though there is a foul and body belonging 
 to every Common-Wealth, yet not fuch a foul and body as I have dif- 
 courft of there. 
 
 For the foul of a Common-Wealth is Actual l Juftice, and in- 
 duftry. 
 
 The foul of a man is Contemplation , Reafon, and imagina- 
 tion. 
 
 And the body of a Common-Wealth, is the Citizens therein, and 
 Magiftrates thereof. 
 
 And the body of a man is the fenfes therein, and the members 
 thereof 
 
 Likewife the ftrength of a Common-Wealth is the Laws, 
 
 And the ftrength of a mans body is the nerves. 
 
 Likewife a fhort copie of verfes which is at the latter end of the 
 book , is what I intended, for this book , as being my beloved of all my 
 works, prefering it as my mafter-piece, although l do beleeve it will 
 not pie afe my Readers, becaufe as I havefaidin fome of my Epi files, 
 few’take delight in the ft udy of Natural Philofophy, yet thofe that de- 
 light not, or flight the ftudy, or dtfpraife the work , make it not 
 the leffe rational, for reafon will be reafon in the defpite of the moft 
 malicious detractors or fophfterian cenfurers,but for the faults and 
 miftakes in my other works , and perchance the like mif chance may 
 come to thefe,and although l know apafsion cannot recal an injury 
 paft : yet I cannnot but grieve at the misfortune, as for a friend that

fbottld be hurt or lamed by fome unhappy accident , but if there be any 
 other faults of indif ere tions in it , I the Author am to be pardo- 
 ned byre af on fomwh at of it was writ in the dawning of my know- 
 ledge , and experience, and not having a clear light I might chance 
 to fumble in dark ignorance on molehills of errors j not that I accufe 
 my book of faults $ but arm my [elf with truth againfi crabbed cenfu- 
 rers. Likewise I do not lay all the faults in my book to the Prin- 
 ters or Correctors charge, for that would be fo great an injujtce , as I 
 could never forgive my felf for the crime, for the Chapters that are 
 mif placed are through my faulty by reafon I fent fome part of it af- 
 ter the book was in the prefle, and itfeems that the Printer or cor- 
 rector not underfunding where to place them-, put them in a wrong 
 place. 
 
 But the literate faults I lay to their charge , whereof l cannot choofe 
 but complain, for in fome places it is fo fa/fly printed, as one word 
 alters the fenfe of many lines ; whereby my book is much prejudiced 
 and not onely by putting infalfe words , as a cofements , for accoutra- 
 ments, ungrateful for ungraceful , mufer for mufler , and the like-, 
 but the fignificancy of words , to exprefje a fingular for a plural yet 
 I mufi confefje that this book is much truer Printed then my book of 
 Poems y for where this book hath one faulty that hath ten $ for which 
 I can forgive the Printer , and Corrector ten times ea filer , then I did 
 for the other y but fetting afide the faults of my book, and complaining 
 thereof y I muf take the liberty in my own behalf to complain of this 
 ill naturedy and unbeleeving age, in not allowing me to be the right 
 dAuthour thereof and though it were an endlejje work to anfwer e- 
 very idle and impertinent queftion, or malicious objection $ for I am 
 off ured that rational, wife, learnedy and juft perfons will never make 
 a doubty knowing that nature hath power to temper a brain as fhe 
 pleafeth both to receive , retain, difcufSy and create, yet for truths 
 fake l am willing to fatisfie my worthy readers (if l can) although 
 I had thought 1 had anfwerdit in my former writings. 
 
 But to anfwer thofe objections that are made again ft me, as frfty 
 how fhould l come by fo much experience, as I have expre fifed in my 
 fever al books to have anfwer, I have had by relation , the long 
 and much experience of my Lord , who hath lived to fee and be in 
 many changes of fortunes, and to converfe with many men offundry 
 nations , ages, qualities, tempers , capacities , abilities , wits, humors, 
 fashions and cujiomes. j 
 
 And as many others, efpecially wives go from church to church, from 
 hall to ballyfrom collation to collation ygofifiping from houfe to houfe, 
 fo when my Lord admits me to his company , I lifien with attention to 
 his edifying difeourfe , and \ govern my (elf by his DoCtrine * v l dance 
 ameafure with the mufes,feafi with the Sciences , or fit and difeourfe 
 with the arts. 
 
 Thefecond is, that fince I am no Scholer ,1 cannot know the names 
 and terms of art , and the divers and fever al opinions of fever al Au- 
 thors, I anfwer, that I muf have been a natural fool ifl had not known 
 and learnt them, for they are cufiomarily taught all children from

their nurfes brefe being ordinarily dif courted of in every family that 
 is of quality, and the family from whence / fprung are neither natu- 
 ral idiots, nor ignorant fools, but the contrary , for they were ratio- 
 nal, learned^ underfunding and wittie . 
 
 And when I [aid I never converf an hour with profejjed Philo- 
 fophers, for indeed in this age, I have not heard of many which do 
 profejfe it, or an intimate acquaintance or familiar converf 'ation 
 with prof eft [cholers, nor fo much difcourfe as to learn from them, for 
 three or four vt fits do not make an intimacy, nor familiarity, nor 
 can much be learnd therefrom, for vifiting and entertaining dif- 
 courfe, for the mof part are either cautionary, frivolous, vain, idle, 
 v i or at leaf: but common and ordinary matter, and mof com- 
 
 monly all vifiting dif courfes, are after one and the fame manner , al- 
 though the company be fever al ’, but I did not think my readers 
 would have been fo rigid as to think I excluded my husband, brothers , 
 and the ref of my family, neither are they profefl Philofophers nor 
 S cholers, although they are learned therein , or to beleeve Iwasfo 
 ridiculoufly f oolifh , or fo foolijhly vain, or fo bafely falfe as that I 
 frive to make the world to beleeve, I had all my experience and 
 knowledge before I was born, and that my native Language came 
 by infind, and that I was never taught my A,B,C -, or the marks 
 and names of fever al things •, but I hope my book hath morefpite- 
 ful enemies then faults ; for I have faid in an Epifle before thefe- 
 condpart of my Olio, that if I had never feen nor heard fo much as 
 I have done , fhould never have been able to have writ a book. 
 
 Thirdly, that 1 had taken feathers out of the Vniverfities to en- 
 large the wings of my fancy ; / anfwer, no more then David took the 
 wooll from his fheeps backs to cloalh his Poetical Phancies of devo- 
 tion, or as I may fay his devout Poelry which is dref with fimuli - 
 
 fog- . . 
 
 But it hath been known in fever al ages, that even poor Peafents 
 that hear nothing but the blating of fheep : the lowing of herds, the 
 crowing of cocks, and the like, and their ordinary dif courfes of nothing 
 but of their market, or the like, have been high flying Poets, politick 
 (iates men, wife (fovernours, prudent Souldiers , fubtle Philofophers, 
 excellent Phyfetians, and what not , even to be eloquent Orators , and 
 Divine preachers, as the holy writ will make manifefl to us, and l 
 beleeve many more are mentioned in other Hifories of leffe authority, 
 thus we may obferve that nature is Prevalent in ad qualities and con- 
 ditions', And fence nature is fo generous to diferibute to thofe that 
 fortune hath cafe out, and education hath neglefled, why fhould my 
 readers miferufe nature fljould be fparing to me, who have been honou- 
 rably born, carefully bred, and nobly married to a wife man, from 
 whom, as I have faid in fame of my Epifeles, in my book called the 
 fVorlds Olio, and do here fay again, and again, ifitwid fatisfee the 
 Traders that J am my Lords Scholer, and as I have learnt, fo Ido

 AN 
 
 EPISTLE 
 
 TO THE 
 
 Reader, for my Book ofPhilofophy. 
 
 Er chance many that read this bock , mil hardly 
 understand it, not but it way be as rational , and 
 as probable , as any that bane writ before , but 
 unleffe they be contemplary perfons, which are not 
 many in our ' nation , especially in the Protejiant 
 opinion, which hue not Monaftical lives, are 
 not fo curious, nor fo inquifitive, after nature , 
 as to fludy that Science -, Befides, they think it unprofitable, bring- 
 ing no advantage -, but they are much mistaken, for that it is a great 
 infight to the knowledge of all Veget ablet, Minerals, and Animals, their 
 conftitutions , their Sympathies, and antipathies, their extractions, and 
 applications which they apply, for health , and prolonging of life-, Be- 
 fides, the fludy in this Science, brings them acquainted with the ccurfe 
 of the fans and planets, and the fever a l tempers of the Climats, 
 and the nature of the fiver al Soyis, which is profitable in husbandry* 
 then it is advantage' cus for the art of Navigation, and plantations, 
 and many other things-, but above all, this fludy is a great delight, 
 and pleafes the curiofuy of mens minds, it carries their thoughts a- 
 bove vulgar and common Objects , it elevates their Spirits to an af- 
 piring pitch $ It gives room for the untired appetites of man, to 
 walk or run in, for fofpatious it is, that it is beyond the comp ajje of 
 time j befides, it gives pleafure in varieties , f or infinite wayes are 
 fir awed with infinite varieties, neither doth it binde up man 
 tothofe flrickt rules as other S dances do, it gives them an hone ft 
 liberty, and proves temperance is the great eft pleafure in nature. 
 Tis true, moral Philofcphy is an excellent fludy, but the do&rine if 
 too ft rid for the pradife, for it teaches more then can be followed, 
 and Theologie is a glorious fludy , but the way is difficult aeul 
 dangerous , for though there are many pathes, yet there is but one that 
 leads to heaven, and thof'e that (lep awrie fall into the Cjulph of 
 damnation, and the deep fludy in this many times blindes the eyes, 
 both of faith and reafon , and inflead of uniting mankind with love,

the bulk of mankinde •, And tofludy Law, is to fludy difjention, to 
 fludy Logick is to fludy deceit, to make falfhood appear like truth 5 to 
 fludy Rhetorick is to jludy words more then fenfe , and many the like 
 fludies are more painful then ufeful , more timeloji then profit got, 
 more tedious then pleafant , more fophifiry then truth. Indeed the 
 Mathematicks brings both profit and pleafure to the life of man, it 
 gives jufi measure and equal weighty it makes all odd reckonings 
 even , itfets all mufical notes , it brings concord out of dif cord, it 
 gives diminution and extention 5 But as I f aid before, few or none 
 but Monafiical men , which live contemplary lives , defpifing the 
 vanities of the world , next to the fervice of Cjod, feek to be ac- 
 quainted with nature , and to obf erve the courf e of' her works , jet in an 
 humble and refpeSful manner , as to admire her curiofity , and to glori- 
 fie and adore the God of nature , for the wonders they finde by her 
 works , and workings: for this reafon,if l had beenfo learned , / 
 would have put my book into Latine , which is a general language 
 through all Europe , and not have writ it in my native Language , 
 which goeth no further then the kingdom of England, wherein I fear 
 my book will finde but little applaufe-, becaufe few therein jludy na- 
 tural Philofophy, and what they underfiand not, they cannot judge of, 
 yet I beleeve all that read will take upon them to give a cenfure,and 
 what their weak braines is not capable to reach at, their attive tongues 
 are capable to pull down , fo that l fear me my book will be lojl in 0- 
 blivion, or condemned by ignorance , unlejje fome generous difpofi - 
 tion which hath a genius in natural Philofophy , and learned ande - 
 loquentin the Latine tongue will tranflate my work', yet I had ra- 
 ther my book fhoulddie in Oblivion, then to be divulged to dif ad- 
 vantage, and injlead of cloathing it in a new garment, they will 
 dif. member the body of fenfe, as to put cut the natural eyes, and put 
 in glajje eyes in the place, or to cut off the legs, and then fet the 
 body upon wooden flumps, but unlejje the Tranflator hath a genius 
 futableto the Author of the Original, the Original will be disfigured 
 with mi flakes ; yet it is e after to tran/late prof e then verfe, for rimes , 
 number, and fenfe, are hard, to match in feveral Languages, it is 
 double labour, and requires double capacitie \ for although Ovid and 
 Dubartus werefo happy as to meet a Sylvefter and a Sands, yet 
 very few or no other had the like good fortune in our Language: for 
 this reaf on I would have turned my <iA tomes out of verfe into prof e, 
 and joynedit to this book, but I fi nding my brain would be like a river 
 that is turned from its natural courf e, which will neither run fo fmooth, 
 fwift,eafle, nor free, when it is forced from its natural motion and 
 courf e, both which mademedefifl &c.

 Cannot think that the fubfiance of infinite mat- 
 ter is onely a body of dufiffuch as f 'malt atoms, and 
 that there is no folidity , but what they make, nor 
 no degrees^ but what they compofe , nor no change 
 and "variety , but as they move , as onely by fleeing 
 about as duff and afhes , that are blown about wiw 
 winde , which me thinks jhouldmake fuch uncer- 
 tainties , fuch dif proportioned figures , and confufed creations , as there 
 would be an infinite and eternal difiorder. Butfurely fuch wandrinv 
 and confufed figures could never produce fuch infinite ejfeffs 3 fuch 
 rare compofitions , fuch various figures , fuch fever al kindes , fuch 
 confiant continuance of each kinde, fuch ex ad rules, fuch undijjol- 
 vable Laws , fuch fixt decrees , fuch order , /Wfo method ,

 which makes me condemn the general opinions of atoms , though not 
 my particular opinions of the figures , £/;<? long atoms make air , 
 
 the round water, the flat fquare earthy alfo that all the other fi- 
 gures are partly fevered from thofe$ alfo the meafure, and the weight 
 of atoms, of flime, flame, of burning, of quenching of fire, and if 
 b the feveral motions, compofitions, and compcfers in their crewing 
 and dijjolving of figures 5 alfo their wars and peace,, their fympaihics 
 C'M antipathies, and many the like 5 but this opinion of mine is, if 
 the infinite, and eternal matter are atoms, but I have confidered 
 that if the onely matter were atoms , and that every atome is of the 
 fame degree, and the fame quantity, as well as of the fame mattery 
 then every atom muji be of a living fubfiance, that is innate mat- 
 0 ter, for elfe they could not move, but would be an infinite dull and 
 immoving body, for figures cannot make motion , unlefje motion be 
 in the matter, and it cannot be a motion that fets them at work without 
 fubfiance, for motion cannot be without fubfiance or produced 
 therefrom, and if motion proceeds from fubfiance, that fub- 
 fiance is moving innately, but if motion is frothing, then every 
 feveral nothings, which are called feveral motions, are gods to infi- 
 nite matter, and our fironger nothing, which is every flronger motion, 
 is god to every weaker nothing , which is every weaker motion ; for 
 if motion depend upon nothing, every particular motion is abfolute$ 
 but the old opinions of atoms feemsnotfo clear to my reafon, as my 
 own, and abfolutly new opinions, which I hear call my Philofophical 
 opinions, which opinions feem to me to be mofi probable, and thefe opi- 
 nions are like Chymiflrie, that from a grofje fubfiance , ex trail the 
 fubfiance and efjence, andfpirits of life , or knowledge which I call the

 Atural Philofophers in their opinions make three gods, 
 the caufer , the worker, and We matter , as God, na- 
 ture, and the Chaos, all three being eternal, as the 
 caufer God was, is, and fhall be, the worker, nature 
 was, is, and fhall be, the matter, chaos was, is, and fhal 
 be, was ever, is prefent, and fhall be eternally, and whatfoever was in 
 its [elf from all eternity , and fhall be to all eternity, is a God, but 
 if they make them all but one thing, then they may fay there is but 
 one God • but if they make them three difiintt things, then they make 
 three Gods, for though they make them all one in unity, yet not in 
 property, but God is like a Center, from whom all infinites flow , as 
 from him, and through him, and to him , his infinite knowledg knowes 
 all pafi, prefent, and what is to come, and is afixt infant.

/ am capable of learnings but let me tell my Readers that what I 
 have learned fince I was married , it is from my Lord , and what lhad 
 learned before it was from wy own families as from my own brothers f 
 for my father died when I was young, and not from f rangers * ? for 
 though I have feen much company, yet 1 have converfl with few, and 
 L I take converfation to be in talking,', which I have not praitifed very 
 much, unlelfe it be to particular friends, for naturally I am fo wedded 
 to contemplations , that many times when 1 have been in company , 1 
 had not known one word they have faid, by reafon my bufie thoughts 
 have flopped the fenfe of my hearing ; and though l prefer the delight 
 of contemplation, before the pleafure of the fenfes,yet when the neerefl 
 and dearefl of my friends f 'peak , as my husband, brothers, flflers , or 
 their children, my affeCtion is f itch that \ give fuch an atenticn to them , 
 as if I had no other thoughts but of what they fay, or any other fenfe but 
 hearing • but as I have faid of the names and tearms of art, and the 
 fever al opinions of the Antients, and the diflinguijhment of the fci- 
 ( nces , and the like , I learned them from my neerefl and dearefl friends 
 as from my own brothers, my Lords brother, and my Lord (but ha- 
 ving the words and termes of art makes me not a Philcfopber) nor a 
 Poet', and if every one in juflice ought to have a due, then nature 
 mufl have a [hare, and truly J will never be fo ingrateful as not to 
 acknowledge her favours, or to belie her in faying jhe hath not been 
 bountiful to me, for jhe hath given me fuch materials, as I hope to 
 build me a monumental fame therewith •, but to fatisfle my %eaders, l 
 will tell them as well as I can how I came to know , and underfland 
 pafjages , all though I never pratlifed, or were a fpectator therein , or 
 thereof ; as put the cafe my husband, or brothers fhould tell me of an 
 Army of horfe and foot, and that two Armies encountred, and fought 
 a battle, and exprefje the forms and figures, rancks and pels, thejianck , 
 the wings the vans, the rears, and the like, by which relation to my con- 
 ceit I fee it in my brain as perfectly, as if the battle was pitcht , and 
 fought there, and my fancy will build difcourfe therefrom. Like- 
 wife if they fhould tell me all the parts of an Animal body , and how 
 they are formed and compofed, I conceive it as perfectly to my under - 
 flanding as if - 1 had feen it dip e tied although I never did and therefore 
 may be deceived in my under flanding, for truly I have gathered 
 more by piece-meals, then from a full relation, or a methodical educa- 
 tion for knowledge ; but my fancy will build thereupon , and make 
 difcourfe therefrom, and fo of every thing they difcourfe of, (l fay 
 they ) that is my husband and brothers •, For the fingularity of my 
 affections are fuch, that thovgh I have an ill memory, and could not 
 if it were for my life relate word for word of any difcourfe, if it be 
 any thing long that I fhall hear from flr angers, for I am the worfi 
 repeater of a flory from fir angers, or out of a book in the world, 
 when from my neer friends ( efpecially my Lord ) whofe difcourfes are

 truth is, I have more materials to build with, then ground to build 
 on, wherby they become ufelefje, but I keleeve time will moulder them 
 to duf, or accidents, asfcknejje may defray them, as dropfes may 
 drown them , fevers may burn them, confumptions may wajte them, 
 or griefs may wither them,or other imployments like ufurpers may throw 
 it out of my head, but as yet my head is fully populated with divers 
 opinions , andfo many phancies are therein, as fometimes they lie like a 
 f warm of bees in a round heap, and fometimes they fue abroad 
 to gather honey from the fweetfiowry rhetorick of my Lords difeourfe, 
 and wax from his wif e judgement which they work into a comb making 
 chapters therein. But thofe that make thefe and the like idle object 1- 
 ons againf me either have not read all my Epifles, and the ref of- my 
 books or under fands them not, but that is not my fault , but their 
 unjuf natures , to cenfure and condemn before they examine 
 or under f and ; Nay they do in fomethings faulfely , ac

 throw againf me, which is mof bafe and cruel to chfm ember my book 
 tormenting it with fpiteful objections , misforming the truth with 
 faljhood : but thofe that have noble and generous fouls will beleeve me, 
 and thofe that have bafe and mechannick fouls, I care not what they 
 fay, and truly I would not have troubled my felf in f riving to fat is fie 
 this prefent age which is very cenforious •, but fear the future age

 they are Sphatncal, yet thole Figures they make by feveral,

 This innate matter is a kinde of god or gods to the dull part of 
 matter , having power to form it, as it pleafe, and why may 
 not every degree of Innate matter be asleveral gods , and fo a 
 jlrong motion be a god to the weaker , and fo have an infinite, and 
 Eternal Government ? As we will compare motions to Officers, or

 Chap. 22. Natural, or Senfivtie War. 
 
 A LL Natural war is caufed either by a Sympathetical mo- 
 tion, or an Antipathetical motion. For Natural war, and 
 Peace proceed from Self-prefervation, which belongs only to the 
 Figure for .nothing is annihilated, in Nature, but the particular 
 prints, or feveral fhapes that motion makes of matter ; which 
 motion in every Figure drives to maintain what they have cre- 
 ated : for when fome Figures deftroyothers , it is for the main- 
 tenance or fecurity ofthemlelves : and when the deftru&ion is 
 for , Food it is Sympathetical motion, which makes a particular 
 Appetite, or nourishment from fome Creatures to others ; but 
 an Antipathetical motion that- makes the DeftruBion.

 of thofe Motions and Figures. As for particular figures?, 
 although every part is feparated that made fuch a figure? yet 
 it is not Annihilated • becaufe thofe parts remain that made it. 
 
 So as it is not impoffible but the lame particular Figures may 
 be erected by the fame motions , that joyned thofe parts, and 
 in the matter may repeat the fame motion eternally fo by fuccefsi- 
 on : and the fame matter in a figure may be ereded and di(- 
 peried eternally. Thus the difperfing ol the matter into par- Either hy 
 ticular figures by an Alteration of motion , we call Death 5 Growth, or 
 and the joyning ol parts to create a Figure , we call life. Death ^"^’ n or

 Matter. 
 
 This Effence? or life? which are Spirits of fenfe, move of- 
 themfelves : for the dull part of Matter moves not, but as 
 it is moved thereby. 
 
 Their common motions (

 Retentive. 
 
 Digeftive.

 Attractive is that which we call Growth , or youth. Retentive , 
 is that we call firengtb . Digeftive is that we call Health , that 
 is an equal diftribution of parts to parts, and agreeing of thofe 
 (pirits. Expulfive is that which we call Death , or decay. 
 
 The Attractive fpirits gather , and draw the materials to- 
 gether. 
 
 The Digefive fpirits do cut and carve out every thing. 
 
 The Retentive do fit, and lay them in their proper places. 
 
 The Expulfive do pul down, and fcatter them about. 
 
 Thofe fpirits moft commonly move according to the matter 
 they work on. For in ipungoand porous light matter, their 
 motion is quick j in (olid, and weighty, their motion is (low- 
 er. For the folid parts are not. oneiy dull, and immoveable 
 of themfelves, but they hinder and * obftrud thofe Spirits 
 of fence, and though they cut and pierce through all, yet it 
 is with more labour, and (lower motion 3 for their motions 
 change according to the quantity and quality of that matter 
 they meet with ; for that which is porous and fpungy, the 
 Figures that they form that matter in, are (boner made, and

 Thefe Senfitive fpirits we may fimilize to feveral workmen, 
 being alwayes bulily imployed, removing, lifting, carrying, 
 driving, drawing, digging, and the like. And although thele 
 fpirits are of lubftance; : thinner then dull matter, yet they are 
 ltrongerby reafon of their fubtility, and motion, which moti- 
 on gives them power : for they are of an acute quality, be- 
 ing the Vitriol , as it were, of Nature, cut and divide all that op- 
 pofeth their way. 
 
 Now thefe fpirts, though they be infinite, yet we cannot 
 think them lo grolfe an infinite, as combuftible matter, yet 
 thofe thinner infinites may cut, and carve the thicker infinites 
 all into feveral figures : like as Aqua-fortis will eat into the 
 hardeft iron, and divide it into fmall parts. 
 
 As I have laid before, the fpirits of life world according as 
 the matter is, for every thing is fhap’d according to the foli- 
 dity of the matter •• like as a man which builds a houfe of 
 fuch wood, which is tough, and ftrong, becaufe he knows 
 otherwife it will break, by reafon of the great weight they are 
 to bear , but to make laths, he takes his wood and cuts it thin, 
 that the nails may the eafier palfe through, fo joyning and fit- 
 ting feveral lorts to proper ufes to build his houfe. Or 
 like a Cook, when he’s to raife a pie, muft take ftiff Dough 5 
 for otherwife it will not onely fall before it be finifhed , but 
 it cannot be raifed, and to make the lids to cover his pye, he 
 muft ufeafofter Pafte, otherwife it will not rowl thin; thus 
 a ftiff pafte is not fit for a lid, nor a thinner pafte for to raife 
 a Pye^it may make a Cake, or fo. So the fpirts of life muft make 
 figures , as the matter is fit; and proper therto , for the figure 
 ot man or the like 5 the fpirits of life take the folid and hard 
 matter for the * Bones : the Glutinous matter for the Sinews, 
 Nerves, Mufcles, and the like 5 and the Oyly matter , for Flefh, 
 Fat, Marrow. So the fluid for Blood, and fuch like matter. 
 and the fpirits themfelves do give this dull matter, motion, not 
 onely in the building of the figure , but to make the figure move 
 when it is built. 
 
 Now the fpirits of life, or lively fpirits do not onely move 
 dull and immoving matter , but makes that matter to move and 
 work upon others 5 for lome kinde of figures fhall make * an- 
 other to refemble it felf, though not juft be as it felf is made, 
 but as the fhadow like the fubftance 5 for it works as a hand 
 that is guided by another, and not of its own ftrength ; that is 
 the reafon. Arts have not fo much perfection as nature. The

 Hj“ He Change of motion in feveral Figures makes ail change and

 effects thereto. And that which we call 'Death, or corruption , 
 is not * an abfence of life, but an expulfive motion which doth *AilMtmU

 death is an annihilation of the Print , not of the Mould of figures 5 
 for the Moulds of thofe figures of Mankinde, Beaft, or Plant, 
 of all kindes whatfoever, fhall never be annihilated fo long as 
 motion and matter lafl, which may alwayes be 5 for-the mould 
 of all figures is in the power of motion , and the fubftance of

 Chap. z6. Of Youth, or Growth. 
 
 T Hus Spirits of fenfe work according to the fub fiance of the 
 matter : for if the matter be porous and light, they form 
 thofe figures quicker, and diffolve them luddenly : But if their 
 matter be folid and hard, they work flower, which makes fome 
 figures longer ere they come to perfection , and not fo eafily un- 
 done. And if their flrength be too weak for the matter they 
 work upon, as wanting help, then the figure is imperfect, ana 
 mifhapen, as we fay. This is the realon Animals and Vegeta- 
 bles , which are yong, have not fo great flrength as when they 
 are full grown ; becaufe there are fewer (pints, and the mate- 
 rials are loofe and unfetled, not knockt clofe : But by degrees 
 more fir its gather together, which help to forward their work, 
 bring in materials by food, fetling them by nourijhment, carrying 
 out by Evacuations that matter that is unufeful, and that Rub- 
 bifh and Chips, as I may fay, which would hinder their mo- 
 tion. If they bring in unufeful matter , their figure increafes 
 not, as we fay, thrives not. And if they carry out the princi- 
 pal materials, the figure decayes, and falls down. But thofe 
 parts of matter which are not spirits, do not carry that part 
 of matter which is Spirit, but thele fir its carry the dull matter 6 
 Thusqhe Jpirits, the innated matter,) move in dull matter, and dull 
 matter moveth by the jpirits 5 and it the matter be fine, and not 
 grots, which they build withal, and their motion be regular, 
 then the figure is beautiful and well proportioned*

 making of another of the fame kinde, is, notonely, that it is 
 of fuch a tempered matter that can onely make fuch a kinde of 
 figure 5 but that the jpirits make figures according to their 
 flrength : So that the jpirits that are in the Seed, when they have 1 mean the Fi- 
 undone the figure they are in, by a general expulfion, which we 8* re °fd*li 
 call corruption , they begin to create again another figure of the m r '

 fame kinde, if no greater power hinder it. For the matter that 
 is proper, to make fuch like figures, is fitted, or temper’d to 
 their llrengths. So as the Temper of the matter , and t he fir ength 
 of the [pints , are the EreBors of thole figures eternally. And 
 the realon, that from one Seed, , lefs, or more Numbers are 
 increafed and rais’d, is, that though few begin the work, more 
 will come to their help ; and as their numbers are increafed, 
 their figures are more, or lefs, weaker, or flronger. 
 
 Chap. 28. Of Decay. 
 
 As a plentiful IT THen Spirit of Life have created a Figure , and brought it 
 
 Emd. agrm to perfedion ; if they did not pull it down again, they 
 
 would be idle, having no work to do ; and Idlenefs is againft 
 •* the nature of life, being a perpetual motion. For as foon as a 
 figure is perfected, the fpirits generally move to an expul five mo- 
 tion. This is the reafon, that Age hath not that flrength as full- 
 growth : But like an old houfe falling down by degrees, fhed 
 ^ their Haires, or Leaves, inflead of Tiles, the Windows broke 
 down, and flopped with Rubbifh. 
 
 So Eyes in Animals grow hollow and dim. And when 
 the Foundation of a houfe is loofe, every little winde {hakes it. 
 So when the Nerves being flack, and the Mufcles untied, and 
 the Joynts unhing’d, the whole Body is weak,and tottering, which 
 we call Talfies : which Palfies , as the winde, fhakes. 
 
 The Bloud , as the Springe dries up, %humes , as Rain falls 
 down, and Vapours^ as Dufi, flieup. 
 
 Chap. 29. O/Dead, and Death. 
 
 D Sad is, where there is a (general Alteration of fuch Motion, 
 as is proper to fuch Figures. But Death is an Annihilation 
 of that Print , or Figure , by an Sxpulfive Motion : And as that 
 Figure diffolves, the Spirits diiperfe about, carrying their feve- 
 ral burdens to the making of other Figures. Like as a houfe 
 that is ruin’d by Time , or lpoyled by accident 5 the feveral Ma- 
 terials are imployed to other ufes fometimes to the building 
 of an houfe again. But a houfe is longer a building then a pul- 
 ling down, by reafon of the cutting, carving, laying, carrying, 
 placing, and fitting every part to make them joyn together ; fo 
 all the works of T^ature are fooner diffolv’d then created. 
 
 Chap. 30. Of Local Shapes. 
 
 S Ome Shapes have power over others, but ’tis not alwayes 
 in the fize, or bulk of the Figure , but in the manner of their 
 Formes that give advantage, or difadvantage. A little Moufe

 will fling a great Figure to death; A Worm will wind through

 in his Hoof 5 The Dogs in his Teeth; The Bulls in his Horns ; 
 and Mans in his Armcs, and Hands ; Birds in their Bills, and 
 Talons : And the manner of their Shapes gives them feveral 
 properties, or faculties. As the Shape of a Bird caufes them to 
 jiye, a Worm to creeps the Shape of a Beaft to rum, the Shape of 
 Fiili to fwim ; yet fomehie fwiftcr, and higher then others, as ■ 
 their Wings are made : Sofome run nimbler then others, ac- 
 cording as their Limbs are made ; and fome fwim glider then a 
 others, according as their Fins are made. tBut CM an- lurpalfes

 were, of every jhape. ) But the lame motion, and the lame mat- 
 ter without the jhape, could not give fiich External Properties ; 
 fince all Internal Properties are wrought out of dull matter. So 
 as it is their jbapes, joyned withfucb motions proper thereunto, 
 that giveth ftrength, and Agilenefs. But the Internal Qualities 
 may be alike in every figure ; bccaufe Rational Spirits work not 
 upon dull matter , but figures themfelves. 
 
 Chap. 31. The Vifible Motion in Ammals, 
 Vegetables, and Minerals. 
 
 T He external motions of Animals are, running, turning, wind- 
 ing, tumbling, leaping, jumping, fhoving, throwing, dart- 
 ing, climbing, creeping, drawing, heaving, lifting, carrying, 
 holding, or haying, piercing, digging, flying, fwimming, di- 
 ving. The Internal motion , is, contriving, directing, examin- 
 ing, comparing, or judging, contemplating, or realoning, ap- 
 proving or difapproving, refolving. From whence arile all 
 the Pajuons, and feveral ‘Di'jpbjitrons. Thefe, and the like, are 
 the vifible Internal motions in Animals. 
 
 The Internal motions of Vegetables , and Minerals , are in ope- 
 ration,; As, contracting, dilating ; which is Attractive, Reten- 
 tive, Digefiive, Expul five. The Vegetables External motion , is, 
 increafing, decreaiing, that is, enlarging, or lafting ; (although 
 there may be matter not moving, yet there is no matter , which is x 
 not moved. )

 Chap. 34. Of their feveral Dances, or Figures. 
 
 Hat Ob] eft foever is prefented unto them by the fen- 
 fes, they ftrait dance themfelves into that figure j 
 this is Mentory, And when they dance the fame figure with- 
 out the help of the outward objeft, this is Remembrance^ when 
 they dance the figures of their own invention,(as I may fay) then 
 that is imagination or Fancie. V nderfianding is, when they 
 dance perfectly (as I may fay) not to miffe the leaft part of 
 thofe figures that are brought through the fenfes. mil is to 
 -dioofe a dance, that is to move as they pleafe, and not as 
 they are perfwaded by the fenfitive [pints. But when their 
 motion and meafures be not regular, or their quantity or numbers 
 fufficientto make the figures perfed, then is the minde weak 
 and infirme, (as X may fay) they dance out of time and 
 meafure. But where the greateft number of thefe, or quanti- 
 ty of thefe EJJence s are met, and joyn’d in the moft regular 
 motion , there is the cleareft undemanding , the deepeft Judge- 
 ment ^ the perfect eft knowledge , the fineft Fancies , the more /- 
 magination , the ftronger memory , the obftinateft mil. 
 
 But lomtimes their motions may be regular ^ butfocietyis 
 lo fmall, fo as they cannot change into fo many feveral figures: 
 then we fay he hath a weak minde, ora poor foul . But be 
 their quantity or numbers few or great, yet if they move 
 confufedly, and out of order, we fay the minde is diftra&ed. 
 And the reafon the minde , or foul is improveable, or decayable, 
 is, that the quantity or numbers are increafeable , or decreafe- 
 able, and their motions regular, and irregular, 
 
 A Feaver in the Body is the fame motion among the fenfi- 
 tive [pints > as madneffe is in the minde amongft the rational 
 Spirits. So likewife pain in the Body is like thofe motions 
 that make grief in the minde. So pleafure in the body is the like 
 motions , as make delight, and joy in the minde , all Convulsive 
 motions in the Body, are like the motions that caufe Fear in the 
 minde. All Expulfive motions amongft the rational [pints , 
 are a difperfing their fociety ; As Expulfity in the Body, is the 
 dilperfing of dull matter by the fenfitive fpirit?. 
 
 All Drugs have an Oppofite motion? to the matter they wofk

 pull down the very materials of a figure. But all Cordials have 
 a Sympathetical motion to the matter they meet, giving ftrength 
 by their help to thofe fpirits they finde tired (as one may 
 fay) that it is to be over-gower’d by oppofite motions in dull 
 Matter,

 Chap. 35. The Sympathy, and Antipathy 0/ Spirits, 
 
 P Leafure, and delight, dif content, and farrow, which is Love, 
 and hate, is like lights and darkneffe 3 the one is a quick, 
 equal, and free motion 5 the other is a flow, irregular, and ob- 
 ftruCted motion. When there is the like motion of Rational 
 Spirits in oppofite figures , then there is a like under ft andmg, and 
 difpofition. juft as when there is the like Motion in t tie fen- 
 fitive fpirits 3 then there is the like conftitution of body. So 
 when there is the like quantity laid in the fame Symmetry, then 
 the figures agree in the lame proportions, and Lineaments of 
 Figures. 
 
 The reafon, that the rational fpirits in one Figure, are de- 
 lighted with the outward form of another Figure , is, that the 
 motions of thofe fenfitive Spirits, which move in that figure, a- 
 gree with the motion of the rational fpirits in the other. This is 
 love of beauty 3 And when the fenfitive motions alter in the 
 figure of the body, and the beauty decayes, then the motion of 
 rational fpirits alter,and the love of god'tjnefie ceales. If the motion 
 of the rational fpirits are crofle to the motion of the fenfitive fpi- 
 rits , in oppoflte figures , then it is diflike. So if the motion be juft 
 crofle and contrary, of the rational fpirits in oppofite figures , it is 
 hate-, but if they agree, it is love. 
 
 But thefe Sympathies , which are made only by a likenefle 
 of motions without an intermixture, laft not long 3 becaufe 
 thofe fpirits are at a diftance, changing their motion without 
 the knowledge, or confcnt of either fide. But the way that 
 the rational fpirits intermix, is, through the Organs of the body, 
 efpecially the eyes, and Eares, which are the common doors, 
 which let the fpirits out, and in. For the vocal, and verbal 
 motion from the mouth, carry the fpirits through the eares 
 down to Heart, where love and hate is lodged. And the fpirits 
 from the eyes iflue out in Beams, and Raies 3 as from the 
 Sun-) which heat, or fcqrch * the hearty which either raife a 
 fruitful crop of love, making the ground fertile, or dries it fo 
 much, as makes it infipid, that nothing of good will grow 
 there, unlefle flunking weeds of Hate : But it the ground be 
 fertile, although every Crop is not lo rich, as fome, yet it never 
 grows barren, unlefle they take out the ftrength with too much 
 kindnefle 3 As the old proverb, they kill with too much kind- 
 nefle 3 which murther is feldom committed. But the rational 
 fpirits* are apt to take Surfet, as well as fenfitive fpirits, which 
 makes love, and Good-mil, fo often to be ill rewarded, neg- 
 lected, and difdain’d. 
 
 Chap. 3 6. The Sympathy of Senfitive, and Rational fpirits 
 in one Figure. 
 
 T Here is a ftrong Sympathy, and agreement, or Affc&ion (as 
 I may fay) betwixt the rational fpirits, and the fenfitive fpi- 
 rits joyned in one figure : like Fellow-labourers that afliftone

another, to help to fmifh their work. For when they dis- 
 agree, as the rational Spirits will move one way Sometimes, 
 and the fenjitive fpirits another ; that is, when reafon drives to 
 abate the appetite of the Senses ; yet it is by a loving direction, 
 rather to admonifh them by a gentle contrary motion for them 
 to imitate, and follow in the like motions ; yet it is, as they 
 aiwayes agree at laft; Like the Father and the Son. For though 
 the father rules by command, and the Son obeies through o- 
 bedience, yet the father out of love to his Son, as willing 
 topleafehim, Submits to his delight, although it is againft his 
 liking;* So the rational spirits oftimes agree with the motions 
 of the fenfttive fpirits, although they would move another 
 way. 
 
 Chap. 3 7. The Sympathy of the Rational and Sensitive Spi- 
 rits , to the Fgure they make , and inhabit . 
 
 A LL the External motion in a Figure , is, by the fenjitive 
 fpirits ; and all the internal, by the rational [pints : and 
 and when the rational and fenjitive fpirits, difagree in oppofite 
 figures , by contrary motion , they oft war upon one another ; 
 which to defend, the fenjitive Spirits and rational fpirits, 
 ule all their force, and power in either Figure ; to defend, 
 or to affault, to Succour, or to deftroy, through an averfion 
 made by contrary motions in each other. 
 
 Now the rational fpirits do not onely choole the materials for 
 their defence, or affault, but do diredf the fenjitive fpirits in the 
 management thereof ; and according to the Strength of the f pi- 
 nts ol either fide, the victory is gain’d, or loft. If the Body be 
 weak, there is like fenfttive Spirit , if the direction be not 
 advantagious, there is leffe rational fpirit. But many times 
 the Alacrity of the rational and fenjitive fpirits, made by mo- 
 ving in a regular motion , overcoms the greater numbers, being 
 in a disordered motion. Thus what is loft by Scarcity, is regain’d 
 by Conformity and 'Unity.

 minde , to exprelfe thofe feveral motions, is onely to be done 
 by guelfe, not by knowledge, as Tome few will I guelfe at 
 Lerve is, when they move in equal number, and even meaiure. 
 
 / Hate is an oppofite motion ; Fear is, when thole fmall bodies 
 tumble on a heap together without order. Anger is, when 
 they move without meafure, and in no uniform Figure. Tn- 
 constancy is, when they move Iwiftly feveral wayes. Conflancy 
 is a circular motion, doubt , and fufpicion , and jealoufie , are when 
 thole fmall bodies move with the odd numbers. Hope is when 
 thole fmall bodies move like wilde-Geefe, one after another. 
 Admiration is, when thole Spherical bodies gather dole toge- 
 ther, knitting fo, as to make luch a circular figure ; and one is 
 to Hand for a Center or point in the midft. Humility is a cree- 
 ping motion. Joy is a hopping, skipping motion. Ambition is 
 * i f ay higher a lofty motion, as to move upwards, or * higher then other 
 for expreffi- motions. Coveting , or Ambition is like a hying motion, mo- 
 ons fane. ving j n feveral Figures like that which they covet for ; if they 
 
 covet for Fame , they put themfelves into luch Figures, as Let- 
 ters do, that exprelfe words, which words are fuch praifes as 
 they would have , or fuch Figure as they would have Sta- 
 tues cut, or Pi&ures drawn : But all their motion which they 
 make, is according to thofe Figures with which they fym- 
 pathize and agree : befides, their motion and figures are like 
 the found of Mufick ; though the notes differ, the cords agree 
 to make a harmony : fo feveral Symmetries make a perfect Fi- 
 gure, feveral figures make a juft number, and feveral quantities 
 or proportions make a juft weight, and feveral Lines make an 
 even meaiure : thus equal may be made out of Diviiions eter- 
 nally, and infinitely. And becaule the figures and motions of 
 the infinite Spirits which they move and make are infinite, I 
 cannot give a final delcription : befides, their motion is fo 
 fubtle. Curious, and intricate, as they are pa ft finding out. 
 
 Some "natural motions worke fo curious fine.

 Chap. 40. O/Thinking, or the Minde, and Thoughts. 
 
 O NE may think, and yet not of any particular thing; that 
 is, one may have fenle, and not thoughts: For thoughts 
 are when the minde takes a particular notice ol feme out- 
 ward ObjeB, or inward idea ; But Thinking is onely a fenfe 
 without any particular notice. As for example ; Thole that 
 are in a great fear, and are amazed, the minde is in confuf’ d 
 fenfe, without any particular thoughts : but when the minde 
 is out of that amaze, it fixes it felf on Particulars , and then have 
 thoughts of paft danger ; but the minde can have no particular 
 thought of the Amaze ; for the minde cannot call to minde that 
 which was not.

Likewifc when we areafieep, the Minde is not out of the 
 Body, nor the motion that makes the fenfe of the minde ceaft, 
 which is Thinking ; but the motion that makes die thoughts 
 therein work upon particulars. Thus the minde may be with- 
 out thoughts, but thoughts cannot be without the minde : yet 
 thoughts go out of the minde very oft* that is* fuch a motion to 
 fuch a thing is ceaft 5 and when that motion is made again, it 
 returns.Thus thinking is the minde, and thoughts the effeS thereof; 
 Thinking is an equal motion without a figure, or, as when we 
 feel Heat, and fee no fire. . i (

 Chap. 41. of the Motions of the Spirits. 
 
 I F it be, as probably it is, that all fenfitive fpirits live in dul 
 matter-, fo rational fpirits live in fenfitive ^Wtt,accordmg to the 
 fhape of thole Figures that the fehcitive fpirits form them. 
 
 The rational fpirits by moving feveral ways, may make fe- 
 vcral kindesof knowledge, and according to the motions of the 
 fenfitive fpirits in their ieveral figures they make, though 
 the fpirits may be the fame, yet their feveral motions may be 
 unknown to each other. Like as a point, that writes upon a 
 Table-book, which when the Letter that was Mrit thereon, is 
 rub’d out, the Table is as plain , as if there were never any let- 
 ter thereon j but though the letters are out, yet the Table- 
 book, and in Pen remain. So although this Motion is gone, the 
 fpirit , and matter remain 5 But if thple fpirits make other kindes 
 of motions, like other kinds of Letters, or Language, thofe 
 Motion underftand not the fir ft, nor the firft underftands not 
 them, being as feveral Languages. Even fo it may be in a found* 
 for that kinde of knowledge xht Figure had in the found , which 
 is an alteration of the motion of the rational fpirits , cauf’d by an 
 alteration of the motion of the fenfitive fpirits in dull matter : 
 And by thefe dilorderly motions, other motions are rub’d out of 
 the Table-book, which is the matter that was moved. But if the 
 fame kinde of letters be writ in the fame place again * that is, 
 when the fpirits move in the fame motion, then the'lame kmveledg 
 is. in that figure, as it was before j the other kinde of know- 
 ledge, which was made by other kinde of motion, is rub’d out*, 
 which feveral knowledge is no more known to each other, 
 then feveral Languages by unlearned men. And as Language is; 
 ftill Language , though not underftood, fo knowledge is liilf 
 knowledge, although not general •, but if they be, defeat we call 
 dead, then thofe letters that were rubbed out, were never writ 
 again 5 which is, the fame knowledge never returns into the 
 fame figures. ' 
 
 Thus the fpirits of knowledge , or the knowledge of fpirits, 
 which is their feveral motion^, may be ignorant and unacquain- 
 ted with each other: that is, that iome motion may not know 
 how other motions move, not onely in feveral fpirits, but in one 
 and the fame fpirit 5 no more then in eyery Effe# can know.

 company, as to make 1 fo'much change, as to take parts, like 
 inftruments of Mufick, which cannot make fuch divifion up- 
 on few firings as upon more. The next, the figure being weak, 
 their motions cannot be ftrong 3 befides, before .the figure is 
 inlarged by growth, they want room to move in. This is the 
 reafon, that new-born Animals feem to have no knowledge,

 Chap. 43. The gathering of Spirits. 
 
 IF the rational fpirits fhould enter into a figure newly created* 
 ^altogether, and not by degrees, a Chiide (for example) 
 would have as much underfianding, and knowledge in the fVomb x 
 or when it is new-born, as when it is inlarged and fully grown. 
 But wefinde by experience there are feveral forts and degrees 
 of knowledge and underfianding, by the recourfe of [pints: which 
 is the reaion, tome figures have greater proportion oi undrr [end- 
 ing and knowledge, and foonerthen others 3 yet it is increafed 
 by degrees, according as rational fpirits incieaie. Like as chil- 
 dren, they muft get ftrength before they can go. So Learning 
 and experience increafe rational fpirits, as Food the fenfitive ; 
 But experience and Learning is not alwayes-tyed to the eare , 
 for every Organ and Pore of the body is as feveral doors to let 
 them in and out : For the rational fpirits living with the fenfitive 
 fpirits, come in, and go out with them, but not in equal propor- 
 tion, bait fometimes more, fometimes fewer : this makes un~ 
 demanding more perfedf in Health then in fickneffe , and in our 
 middle age, more then in the latter age : For in age and Tick- 
 nefle there is more carried out, then brought in. This is the rea- 
 fon. Children have notfuch understanding, but their reafon 
 increafeth with their years. But the rational fpirits may be 
 {imilized * to a company of Good-fellows, which have pointed 
 a meeting 3 and the company coming from feveral places, 
 makes their time the longer ere their numbers are compleated, 
 though many a brain is difappointed 3 but in fome figures the 
 rooms are not commodious to move in, made in their Creation, 
 for want of help : thofe are Changelings, Innocents*, or Natu- 
 ral Fools. . . 
 
 The rational fpirits feem moft to delight in fpungie foft and 
 liquid matter 3 as in the Bloody Brainy NerveSy and in Vegetables 3 as 
 not onely being neereft to their own nature, but haying more 
 room to move in. This makes the rational fpirits tp choofe 
 the Head in Animals , for their chief room to dance their Figures 
 in : * for the Head is the biggeft place that hath ithe Jpun- 
 gy c Materials ^ thus as foon as & figure is created, thofe. rational

 are the Caufe, motion but an Effect therefrom : For that thin 
 matter which is fpirits, can alter the motion , but motion can- 
 not alter the matter, or nature of thofe Ejjences, or fpirits ;fo 
 as the fame fpirits may be in a body, but not one and the fame 
 knowledge , becaufe not the fame motion, that made that know- 
 ledge. As for example 5 how many levcral Touches belong to 
 the body ? for every part of the body hath a feveral touch, 
 which is a feveral knowledge belonging to every feveral part; 
 for every feveral part doth not know, and feel every feveral 
 touch. For when the head akes, the heel feels it not, but onc- 
 ly the Rational fpirits which are free from the incumbrance of 
 dull matter, they sac agile, and quick to take notice of every 
 particular touch, in, or on every part of the figure. The like 
 motions ol a pain in the Body . The like motions of the Ratio- 
 nal fpirits, we call grief in the minde ; and to prove it is the 
 like motion of the Rational Spirits to the fenfitiue, which makes 
 the knowledge of it, is, when the rational Spirits are bufily 
 moved with fome Fantafmes, if any thing touches the body , 
 it is not knownto the rational fpirits, bccaufe the rational fpi- 
 rits move not in fuch motion, as to make a thought in the head, 
 of the touch in the heel, which makes the thoughts to be as fenfe- 
 leffeofthat touch, as any other part of the body, that hath not 
 fuch paines made by fuch motions. And fhall we fay, there 
 is no fenfe in the heel, becaufe no knowledge of it in the head? 
 we may as well fay, that when an Objeft ftands juft before an 
 eye that is blinde, either by a contrary motion of the thoughts in- 
 ward, by fome deep Contemplation, or otherwife : we may 
 as well fay there is no outward objeft, becaufe the rational 
 fpirits take no notice of that ObjeB ; tis not, that the ftrongcr 
 motion ftops the lelfe, or the fwifter , the flower; for then the 
 motions of the Planets wold ftop one anothers courfe. 
 
 Some will fay, what fenfe hath man, or any other Ani- 
 mal when they are dead ? it may be anfwered, that the Pi- 
 gnre, which is a body, may have f enfe, but not the Animal-, for 
 that we call Animal, is fuch a temper’d matter, joyn’d in fuch a 
 figure, moving with fuch kinde of motions ; but when thofe mo- 
 tions do generally alter, that are proper to an Animal, although 
 the matter, and Figure remain, yet it is no longer an Animal, 
 becaufe thofe motions that help it to make stnAnimal are ceas’d 
 So as the Animal can have no more knowledge of what kind of 
 fenfe the Figure hath ( becaufe it is no more an Animal) then an 
 Animal, what fenfe duft hath. And that there is the reafon, that 
 when any part is dead in an Animal , if that thofe motions that 
 belonged to the Animal, are ceas’d in that part, which alter it 
 from being a part of the Animal, and knowes no more what 
 fenfe it hath,then if a living man fhould carry a dead man upon 
 his {boulders, what fenfe the dead man feels, whether any,

 TTT THatfoever hath an innate motion , bath knowledge^ 
 
 \ V and what matter foever hath this innate motion, is 
 knowings : but according to the feveral motions, are feveral 
 knowledges made * for knowledge lives in motion , as motion lives 
 in matter: for though the kind of matter never alters, yet the 
 manner of motions alters in that matter : and as motions alter,fo 
 knowledge differs, which makes the feveral motions in feveral 
 figures to give feveral knowledge. And where there is a like- 
 nefle of motion , there is a likeneffe of knowledge : As 
 the Appetite of sSifitive [pints, and the defire of rational [pi- 
 nts are alike motions in feveral degrees of matter. And the 
 touch in the heel, or any part of the body elfe, is the like mo- 
 tion, as the thought thereof in the head 3 the one is the motion » 
 of tht [enfitive fpirits, the other in the rational [pints, as touch 
 from the fenfitive fpirits, for thought is onely a ftrong touch, 
 and touch a weak thought . So lenie is a weak knowledge, and 
 knowledge a iktong[en[e, made by the degrees of the fpirits ; for 
 Animal [pints are ftronger (as I faid before) being of an high- 
 er extraft ( as I may fay) in the Chymiftry of Nature, which 
 makes the different degrees in knowledge, 1 fy the difference in 
 ffrengths and fineneffe, or fitbtlety of matter .

 becaufe all things have of thefe fpirits in them 3 and if Senfi- 
 tive [pirits, why not rational fpirits > For there is, as much infi- 
 nite of every feveral degree of matter, as if there were but qiie

Animal way. And if their knowledge be not the fame know- 
 ledge^, but different from the knowledge of Animals, by reaion 
 of their different figure f, made by other kinde of motion on o- 
 ther tempered matter, yet it is knowledge. For fhall we fay, 
 A man doth not know, becaufe he doth not know what ano- 
 ther man knows, or fome higher power? 
 
 Chap. 47 . what an Animal is. 
 
 A N Animal is that which we call fenfitive [pint $ that is, 
 a figure that hath local motion ; that is, luch a kinde of 
 figure with fuch kinde of motions proper thereunto. But when 
 there is a general alteration of thole motions in it, then it is no 
 more that we call Animal becaufe the local motion is altered; 
 yet we cannot knowingly fay, it is not a fenfitive Creature , fo 
 long as the figure lafts : befides,when the figure is dilfolved,yet 
 every (battered part may have fenfe, as long as any kinde of mo- 
 tion is in it ; and whatfoever hath an innate motion, hath fenfe, 
 either increafing or decreafing motion ; but the fenfe is as diffe- 
 rent as the motions therein, becaufe thofe properties belonging 
 to luch a figure are altered by other motions. 
 
 Chap. 48. ^ Of the difperling of the Rational Spirits. 
 
 COme think, that the Rational [pirits flye out of ^Animals , 
 or that Animal we call Man) like a (warm of Bees , when 
 they like not their hives, finding fome inconvenience, feek 
 about for another habitation, or leave the body, like Rats, 
 when they find the houfe rotten, and ready to fallj Or fear’d a- 
 way like Birds from their Neft. But where fhould this Swarm, 
 Or Troop, or Flight, or E (fences go, unlelfethey think this 
 thin matter is an E fence, evaporates to nothing ? 
 
 As I have faiabefore, the difference of rational [pints, and 
 fenfitive [pints, is, that the fenfitive [pints make figures out of 
 dull matter ; The rational [pirits put themfelves into figure, pla- 
 cing themfelves with number, and meafure 5 this is the realbn 
 when Animals die, the External Form of that Animal may be 
 perfed, and the Internal motion of the [pirits quite alter’d, yet 
 not abfent, not difpers’d untill the Annihilating of the External 
 figure : thus it is not the matter that alters, but the Motion and 
 Form. 
 
 Some Figures are ftronger built then others, which makes 
 them laft longer : for fome, their building is lo weak, as they 
 fall as loon as finilhed 5 like houfes that are built with (lone, 
 or Timber, although it might be a ftone-houfe,or timber-houfe, 
 yet it may be built, not of luch a fort of Stone, or fuch a fort of 
 Timber.

 Any perchance will laugh in fcorn at my

 think thofe things I have described 
 fhouldbe made with fuch a kinde of 
 Motion, my anfweris, thatlguefsby 
 the forms, I mean the figures, or fhapes, what the 
 motion may be to produce them • for I fee the fi- 
 gure of afourleg’d Creature hath other motions 
 then two legged Creatures, or then thofe Crea- 
 tures that have no legs • and I fee fome fiiape Crea- 
 tures that can flee, by reafon of their figures, which 
 is made proper to produce that kinde of motion 5 
 for thofe thacaienot made fo, cannot do fo. By 
 this I think it probable that Internal motions, are 
 after the manner of External motions 3 for we 
 may guefsat the caufe by the effe&s,lo by the fi- 
 gures of Snow, Frofi, Hail, Rain, Vapor, and the 
 like, we may guefle at other Internal, or external 
 motions, that produced their External figures, or 
 alterations, and by the effects of light, darknefle, 
 heat, cold, moifture, what manner ofmotionspro- 
 duced them; wherefore I know no reafon why any 
 fhould condemn my opinions. Butthe cuftom of

SocrateSy and the reft of ancient Authors, or elfc

 any of their opinions; For though in natural Philo- 
 fophy there maybe many touches found out by ex- 
 periences, and experiments, yet the Study is onely 
 conje&urally, and built upon probabilities, and 
 until probabilities be condemned by abfolute and 
 known truth, let them have a place among ft the 
 reft of probabilities, and be not fo partial to con- 
 tradift, as to be unjuft to me, take not away the 
 right of my place becaufe young; for though age 
 ought to have refpe£f, yet not fo as to do youth

 my felf, for next to the finding out oftruthes, the 
 greatefi plea fare in Study, is, to finde out proba-

 efteem this work of mine, but what foever is new, 
 is not received at the firft with that good accep- 
 tation, by reafon it is utterly unknown unto them,

 tion, as an infinite, and eternal dull lump ; For I fee no 
 reafon, but infinite might be without running forward, or 
 circle-wayes, if there were not feveral degrees of the onely 
 Matter, wherein Motion is an Infinite Eternal effed of fuch 
 a degree. Neither is it nonfenfe to fay, Figure is the effed of 
 Matter ; for though there is no Matter without Figure, yet 
 there could be no figure without Matter, wherefore Matter 
 is the prime caufe of Figure, yet there could be no figure 
 without matter, wherefore matter is the prime caufe of figure, 
 but not figure of matter, for figure doth not make matter, 
 but matter figure, no more then the creature can make the 
 Creator; but a creature may make a figure. Thus although 
 there is no firft matter, yet matter is the firft caufe of moti- 
 on and figure; and all effeds. 
 
 Although they are as infinite and Eternal, as matter it felf, 
 and when I fay Matter prime, I fpeak for diftindion fake, 
 which is the onely Matter ? 
 
 The inpated Matter, is the foul of Nature. 
 
 The dull part of Matter, the Body. 
 
 And the infinite figures, are the infinite form of Nature. 
 And the feveral motions are the feveral adions of nature. 
 
 Chap. 6 2. OfCaufes, and ef efts. 
 
 A S I have faid before the effeds are infinite, and eternal 
 as the Caufes, becaufe all effeds lie in matter and mo- 
 tion, indeed in matter onely 5 for motion is but the effed of 
 matter. 
 
 Wherefore all particular figures although dfliolvable yet 
 is inherent in the matter, and motion, as for example, if a 
 man can draw the pidure of a man, or any thing elfe, al- 
 though he never draws it , yet the Artis inherent in the man, 
 and the pidure in the Art as long as the man lives, fo as long 
 as there is matter, and motion, which was from all Eternity, 
 and (hall be eternally; the effed will be fo.

 Chap. 6 3. whether motion is a things or nothings or 
 can be Annihilated 
 
 COme have opinion that Motion is nothing, but to my reafon 
 "‘-'it is a thing; tor if matter, is a lubftance,a iubftance is a thing, 
 and the motion, and matter being unfeparablely, united, makes 
 it but one thing. 
 
 For as there could be no motion without fuch a degree, or 
 extract of matter to there could be no fuch degree or ex- 
 tract of matter without motion, thus motion is a thing. But 
 by reafon particular motions leave moving in fuch matters 
 and figures, (hall we fay they are decealed , dead, or be- 
 come nothing; but fay fome, motions are accidents, and acci- 
 dents are nothing ; but I fay, all acccidents live in Iubftance, 
 as all effects in the caules , lay lome, when a man for ex- 
 ample fhakes his hand, and when he leaves fhaking, whether 
 is that motion gone (fay others) no where, for that parti- 
 cular motion ceafeth to be,fay they. 
 
 I anfwer, that my reafon tells me, it is neither fled a- 
 way, nor ceal'ed to be, for it remains in the hand, and in that 
 matter that created the hand, that is in that, and the like in- 
 nated matter, that is in the hand. But fome will fay, the 
 hand never moves lo again, but X fay the motion is never the 
 lelfe there, they may as well fay, when they have feen a 
 Cheft full of Gold, or the like, and when their eyes are fhut, 
 or that they never fee it more, that the Gold doth not lie in 
 the Cheft, although the Gold may lie there eternally, or if 
 they fhould fee it again, fay it is not the fame Gold. So like- 
 wile particular motions are, but fhewed,not loft, or Annihila- 
 ted : or fay one fhould handle a velfel often, that every time 
 you handle the velfel, it is not the lame touch, velfel, or 
 hand, and if you never touch the velfel again, that the hand, 
 velfel, or touch is annihilated. 
 
 But particular motion, as the veftels, or hand is but uled, 
 not annihilated, for particular motions can be no more an- 
 nihilated , then particular figures that are dilfolved and how, 
 in reafon can we lay in reafon particular figures are 
 Annihilated, when every part and parcel, grain, and atome, 
 remains in infinite matter, but lome will lay, when a houfe: 
 for example , is pull’d down, by taking afunder the materials, 
 that very figure of that houfe is annihilated ; but my opini- 
 on is, that it is not, for that very figure of that houfe remains 
 in thofe materials,and fhal do eternally although thofe materi- 
 als were dilfolved into Atoms, and every Ato me in a fevera* 
 place,part,or figure & though infinite figuresfhould be made by 
 thofe materials by feveral dilfolutions and Creations, yet thole 
 infinites would remain in thofe particular materials eternally, 
 and was there from all eternity; And if any of thofe figures

 be rebuilt, or Created again, it is the fame figure it was. 
 
 Solikewife the motion of the hand which I faid for exam- 
 ple, if the lame hand moves after the fame manner, it is 
 the fame motion that moved the hand before ; fo it may make 
 infinite repetitions ; thus one and the lame motion may move 
 eternally, and reft from moving, and yet have a being. 
 
 Chap. 6 4. Of Motions. 
 
 T 'Here are millions of feveral motions which, agree to the 
 making of each figure, and millions of feveral motions 
 are knit together ; for the general motion of that are figure, 
 as if every figure had a Common- Weale of feveral Motions 
 working to the lubfiftence of the figure, and feveral forts of 
 motions, like feveral forts of Trades hold up each other ; fome 
 as Magiftrates, and rulers; others as Train-bands, as fouldiers; 
 lome make forts , and dig trenches ; fome as Mer- 
 chants that traffick ; fome as Sea-men , and Ship- 
 maftcrs ; lome that labour and and work, as fome cut 
 and carve ; Others paint, and ingrave ; lome mix, and 
 temper , joyn, and inlay , and glue together ; fome form, 
 and build ; fome caft in moulds, and fome makes moulds to 
 call ; fome work rough-cafts ; lome pollifh and refine 3 
 fome bear burthens , lome take off burthens , fome digg, 
 fome fowe, fome plough , lome fet , fome graft, fome plant, 
 fome gather , fome reap , fome lift , fome thrafh , fome 
 grind , fome knead , fome bake , fome beat , lome fpin, 
 icme weave , fome fewe together , fome wind and twift, 
 lome create , and others dilfolve , and millions of millions of 
 motions, but as we fee external, fo we may imagine are internal 
 motions. 
 
 Chap. 6 5. Many motions go to the producing of one 
 thing , or to one end. 
 
 F Or there are millions of feveral motions go to the 
 making of one figure, or in mixing, as I may fay, of feve- 
 ral degrees of the dull part of matter, as I will give one for 
 example in grolfe external motions, where I will deferibe it 
 by digeftive motions, which is to fit parts, and to diftri- 
 bute parts to feveral places proper to the work. For digeftive 
 motions, there are many feveral forts, or kinds of motions mixt 
 together, as for example, a piece of meat is to be boyled,or 
 the like, fome motions cut luel, and others take it up, others 
 carrie, other lay down in a Chimnie, or the like place,others 
 put fire,others kindle it, and make it burn, others take met- 
 tle and melt it, others caft fuch a figure as a pot, others bring 
 the pot, others fet it over the fire, others take up water, 
 others carry that water to the pot, others put that water in- 
 to the pot, others kill a fheep, others -divide it into parts, 
 
 others

 others put it a part into the pot. Thus a piece of meat can- 
 not be boyled 'without all thefe motions, and many more, 
 which would be too tedious to relate, for I could have in- 
 larged it three times as many more, only to boyl a piece of 
 meat, and if there be fo many feveral motions in our groffe 
 fenfe in fuch things as thefe,. then what is there in infinite Na- 
 ture, yet for all thefe infinite varieties of motions, as Ifaid 
 before , I cannot perceive but fix ground-motions, or funda- C 
 mental motions, from whence all changes come, which are 
 thefe attradive motions, contrading motions, retentive moti- 
 ons, dilative motions digeftive motions, and expulfive motions; c 
 likewife, although there be infinite kindes, and different fi- 
 gures, yet the groundwork, from whence arifeth all the ve- c 
 riety, is but from four figures ; as Circular, Triangular, Cupe, 
 and Paralels. And as there are infinite changes of motions, 
 amongft the fenfitive innated matter, working on the dull 
 parts of matter, fo there are infinite changes of motions in 
 the rational innated matter, making infinite kinds of know- 
 ledge, and degrees of knowledge, and underftanding, and as 
 there are infinite changes of motion,fo there are infinite effeds, 
 and every produced effed, is a producing effed , and effeds 
 which effed produce effeds , and the onely matter is the 
 caufe of all effeds, for the feveral degrees of onely matter, 
 is the effed of onely matter, and motion is the effed of 
 fome forts of the degrees of onely matter, and varieties are the 
 the-effeds of matter and motion, and life is the effed of in- 
 nate matter ; and knowledge the effed of life. 
 
 Chap. 66. Of the fix principal motions.' 
 
 A S I have faid, there are infinite Contradions, Atradions, 
 Retentions, Dilations, digeftions, and expulfions, and to 
 •explain my felf to my readers as well as I can, unleffe they 
 fhould miftake me, I will here defcribe , although after a 
 mg^fe way ; yet according to my capacity. A few of the in- 
 ftmte variety of motions, firft there are five, or fix principal 
 motions, from whence infinite changes are made, or produ- 
 ced, as from Contradions, Attradions, Retentions ; thefe three 
 principal motions do in fome kinde fimpathize to each other; 
 and dilations, and expulfions do alfo fympathize to each other, 
 but digeftions is a mixt motion taking part of all, but I divide 
 them into fix parts, for diftindion ; Now to treat of them fe- 
 verally, wemuft make an imaginary Circumference, and 
 Center. 
 
 Then firft for Attrading motions, which is to draw towards 
 the Center, that is, to draw to a leffe compaffe, as to draw to- 
 wards a point, yet Atradions draw not alwayes after one 
 and the fame manner, for fome motions draw after them, as 
 horfes do Coaches, Carts, fleds and the like, but after fe- This for

 veral fa fh ions, forms, and biafies and feveral motions, in thofe 
 motions fome flow, fome quick, fome crofie, fome even. 
 Again, fome times Attractive motions draw, as if one fhould 
 pull in a line , or draw in a net , fome flope-wayes, fome 
 ltraight wayes^ fome fquare wayes, fome round wayes ; and 
 millions bf the like varieties, in this fort of motion, yet all 
 Attracting motion. 
 
 Secondly, Contracting motions which move after another 
 manner; for though both thefe forts of motions, are to bring to- ' 
 wards a point, yet Contraction me thinks, firives more a- 
 gainft Vacuum , then Attraction, gathering all into a firm body, 
 Sopping up all porous paffages, fhutting out lpace, and ga- 
 thering in matter, as dole as it can ; indeed Attractions are but 
 in the way to Contractions, as Dilations to expuifions; but 
 this fort of motions is, furfling, pleating, folding, binding, 
 knitting, twitting, griping, prefiing, tying, and many the like, 
 and after feveral manners,' or fafhions. 
 
 Thirdly, Retention is to hold, or to flay from wandring, 
 to fik, as I may fay, the matter to one place, as if one fhould 
 ftick, or glue parts together. 
 
 Fourthly; Dilations are to inlarge, as to fpend, or extend, 
 driving for fpace, or compafTe ; it is an incroaching motion, 
 which will extend its bounds as far as it can, this fort of mo- 
 tion is melting, flowing, ftreaming, fpreading, fmoothing, 
 ftretching,and millions of the like. 
 
 ~ F'iftly, Expulfive, is a motion that fhuns all unity, it firives 
 againft folidity, and uniformity, it difperfes every thing it 
 hath power on; this fort of motion, is, breaking, diffolving, 
 throwing about. 
 
 Sixthly, Digeftive motions, are the creating motions, carry- 
 ing about parts to parts, and fitting, and matching, and joyning 
 parts together, mixing and tempering the matter for pro- 
 per ufes.

 Some are, as if a man fhould drive a wheel-barrow, or 
 rolling of barrels, or driving a plough, or a rowler, and mil-

 Others are, as if beafls and men were to carry burthens, mo " 
 lome bearing burthens on their beck ; fome on their head; 
 fome in in their mouth , lome in their arms 3 fome in their 
 hands; fome under their armes 3 fome on their thighs; fome 
 on their flings, as Bees do , and millions the like, and eve- 
 ry one of thole burthens, have feveral motions thereto, and yet 
 all but bearing motions. 
 
 Other forts of motions, as throwing the bar, pitching the Throwi 
 bar, throwing a ball, firiking a ball, throwing a bowl, fling- ftriking, dar- 
 ing a dart, darting a dart, throwing upward, downward, ting motions, 
 ftraight-out, fide-wayes, and all thefe feveral manners, is but 
 a throwing motion.

 ted body, which we call fenfe and reafon, which fenfe and 
 reafon, may be in every thing, though after different man- 
 ners, but we have confined fenfe, onely to animal kinde, 
 and reafon onely to mankinde ; but if the innated matter is in 
 the dull parts of matter, as the life of the body, then there 
 is no part that hath not fenfe and reafon whether creating or 
 created , dilfolving, or diffolved, though I will not lay that 
 every creature enjoys life alike, lb every figure is not innated 
 alike, for fome is weaker innated, and lome ftronger, either 
 by quantity or degree, yet every figure is innated; for it is 
 innated matter that creates, and dilfolves figures, yet the innated 
 matter works according to the feveral degrees, and tempers, 
 of the dull part of matter, and to luch properties, and figures, 
 and figures properties, and proper figures, that is, motion 
 doth form the onely matter, into figures, yet mofion can- 
 not alter the Entity of only matter, but motion can, and doth 
 alter the interior, and exterior figures, and though the fove- 
 ral degrees of matter may be placed, and replaced in figures, 
 yet the nature of the matter cannot be altered. 
 
 Chap. 70. The creations of figures^ and difference 
 ” of Motions. 
 
 ZZT Hofe motions that are proper to create figures 3 are dif- 
 ferent from thofe motions that dilfolve them, io that 
 fympathetical internal motions , do not onely alfift 
 one another , but Sympathetica! external Motions , and 
 Sympathetical figures; this is the reafon that from two fi- 
 gures, a third, , or more is created, by the way of procrea- 
 tion; yet all figures are created, after one and the fame 
 kinde of way ; yet not after one and the fame man- 
 ner of way, <jis Vegetables, Minerals, and fome forts of 
 Animals, asfuch as are bred from that we call corruption, as 
 fome forts of worms, and fome forts of flies, and the like; 
 Yet are they created by the procreation of the heat, and 
 moifture, the fame way are plants that grow wilde produ- 
 ced, but thofe that are fown or let, although they are after 
 Qne and thb fame kinde of way, yet not after the fame 
 manner; for the young vegetables, were produced from the 
 feeds, and the earth , which were fowed, or let together, 
 and in grafts is when two different plants produce feed of 
 mixt nature,. as a Mule is produced^ or the like creature, from 
 IWp different Animals; which maVe them of mixt nature;for 
 AS there ‘is a Sympathetical conjunction in one, and the fame 
 Made of figure , io • there is a Sympathetical conjunction in 
 feme forts of' figures; but not in 'ail , 1 nor to all, for that 
 wpuldrfiakec ftich a tortfttfion in nature, as there would be no

being fuch a difference betwixt them, fome from the nature 
 of the figures, others from the fhape of the figures. 
 
 And Minerals are produced by the Conjunction of fuch Ele- 
 ments, which were begot by fuch motions, as mate heat, and 
 drought, and cold and dry .Thus all figures are created from dif- 
 ferent motions, and different degrees, of infinite onely matter ; 
 for. onely matter joyns, and divides it felf by felf motions, and 
 "hath done fo , and will do fo, or muff do fo eternally ,being its 
 nature, yet the divilions, and fubftrabtions, joynings, and crea- 
 tions, are not alike, nor do they continue, or diffolve, with 
 the like meafure of time, which time is onely as in a reference 
 to feveral motions. . , ^ C 
 
 But as I have laid, there can be, nothing loft in nature. 
 Although there be infinite changes, and their changes never 
 repeated. For fay a man dies, and his figure diffolves into 
 duft, as final as Atoms, and is dilpcrft fo, as never to meet, 
 and every Atome goeth to the making of levcral figures, and 
 fo changes infinitely, from figure, to ; figure, yet the figures 
 of all thefe Changes lie in thofe parts, and tliofe parts 
 in onely matter , fo likewife feveral motions may ceafeas 
 figures diffolve, but ftill thofe motions lies in innated matter, 
 and' each particular figure, in the generality of matter and 
 motion, which is on the dull part,- and innated part of one- 
 ly matter. • ,, >-• ;

 got others, and as thefe Elemental Planets beget in general 
 all figures, which we call creatures in the world ; fo thefe fi- 
 gures, as they are matched, beget each particular figures of 
 Several forts ; For external figures, are made by internal mo- 
 tions; for though Vegetables, Minerals, and Animals be in- 
 ternal figures, as to the globe of the World, which is the ex- 
 ternal figures to them, yet they are external figures to thofe 
 which are created in them, untill fuch time as they are caft

 diverfity of motion, there is fuch varietie , as feldom any two 
 creatures are alike, for motion delights in variety, not fo much 
 in the different kindes, as in the particular creatures, 
 which makes me think that motion is bound by the nature of 
 the matter , to make fuch kindes ; Although it be at liberty 
 for particulars, and yet the feveral kindes may be as infinite

 nor a diamond like a pibble ftone; fo there may be infinite 
 worlds, and infinite variety of worlds, and be all of that kinde 
 we call worlds, yet be nothing alike, but as different , as if 
 it were of another kinde, and may be infinite feveral kinds 
 of creatures, as feveral forts, that we can never imagine, nor 
 gueffe at ; for we can gueffe, nor imagine at no other wayes, 
 but what our fenfes brought in, or our imaginations raifed up, 
 and though imaginations in nature may be infinite, and move 
 in every particular brain after an infinite manner ; yet it is 
 but finite in every particular figure, becaufe every particular fi- 
 guse is finite, that is every particular figure comes by de- 
 grees from creation to a full growth, from a full growth tfo 
 a decay, from a decay to a difiolution; but not a Annihilation, 
 for every particular figure lies in .the foody infinite, as well as 
 every particular kinde ; for unleftg eternalmatter, and infinite 
 matter, and eternal and infinite motions could be Annihilated, 
 infinite figures wil eternally remain,althoughnot in their whole 
 bulk, yet in their parted pieces; for though one and the fame 
 matter may be made into other figures : yet the former fi- 
 gures have as much a being as the prefent figures, by reafon the 
 matter that was the caufe of thofe figures hath an eternal being, 
 and as long as the caufe lafts, the effects cannot be Annihi- 
 lated.

 T He divifions, and fubftra&ions, joynings, and creations, 
 are not alike, nor do they continue, and diffolve with the 
 like meafures of time .; for feme Vegetables are old, and de- 
 crepit at a day old, others are but in their prime after a 
 hundred yeers, and fo home Animals, as flies and the like, are 
 old and decrepit at ayeer old; others,, as man As but at his 
 prime at twenty yeers , and will live a hundred yeers, if he be 
 healthy and found; loin the Minerals, perchance lead, or tin, 
 or the like, is but a flie, for continuance to gold, or like a 
 flower to an oak, then it is probable, that the Sun and the reft 
 of the Planets, Stars, and Millions more that we know not, 
 may be at their full ftrength at ten hundred thoufand yeers, 
 nay million of millions of yeers, which is nothing to eternity,

 or perchance, as it is likely, other figures were at full ftrength 
 when matter and motion created them, and fhall la ft until 
 matter diffolves them. Again, it is to be obferved that all 
 Spherical figures laft longeft,I think it is becaufe that figure 
 hath no ends to ravel out at. 
 
 Chap. 75. Of gold. 
 
 COme fay that Gold is not to be altered from the figure that 
 ^makes it gold, becaufe Chymifis have tried and cannot do it, 
 but certainly that innated motion that joyns thofe pans, 
 and fo made it in the figure of Minerals can difTolve thofe 
 parts, and make it into fome figure elfe, to exprefTe an other 
 thing ; but being a more folid part of dull matter then that 
 which makes other minerals, it is longer a creating, and diffol- 
 ving,then the other figures are, that are of a light or lofter fub- 
 ftance, and may be the motions that make gold, are of flow- 
 er nature , fo as it is caufedfrom thehardneffe of the mat- 
 ter, or the flowneffe of the fpirit, caufed by the curiolity of 
 the work, wherein they muft ufe more different motions then 
 in other figures; fo as it may be a thoufand yeers uniting, or 
 a thoufand yeers a difperfing, a thoufand, nay ten thoufand 5 
 for there is no account, nor time in nature infinite, and be- 
 caufe we laft not fo long as to perceive it, fhall we fay that 
 Gold was eternal, and fhall laft eternally; fo we may as well 
 fay an Oak,that is a hundred yeers,ere it comes to full maturity, 
 and a hundred yeers, ere it comes to be diffoved, that it was an 
 Oak eternally, and fhall be fo eternally,becaufe a flower, is crea- 
 ted, and diffolved in two or three dayes, but the folidity of the 
 matter, and the curiofity in the feveral changes, and enter- 
 changes of motions prolong the work, yet it is haftened, or re- 
 tarded by the quantity of lpirits that work therein ; for when 
 there is more, it is fooner formed, when lefs, longer ere it 
 come to its figurative perfection.

 fo, for be doth not abfolutely know it, for thought is not an 
 abfolute knowledge but a luppoficive knowledge, for there 
 are as many feveral degrees of knowledge, as of innate matter 
 which is infinite, and therefore not abfolute, and as much va- 
 riety of knowledge, as there is of motions, and though all in- 
 nated matter is knowing , yet all innated matter is not 
 known; this makes figures to have of each others a fuppofitive, 
 but not an abfolute knowledge ; thus infinite makes innated 
 matter in fome kinde, aftranger to it felf, yet being know- 
 ing , although not known, it makes an acquaintance with 
 parts of it felf, and being various by interchanging motions* 
 it alfo lofeth acquaintance; the acquaintance we call learning, 
 invention, experience, or memory, the unknown, or not ac- 
 quainted we call dupidity, ignorance, forgetfulneffe, illiterate, 
 but by the acquaintance of experience, we come to findethe 
 ufe of many things, and by the ufe we come to learn, and 
 from our learning we come to pra&ife, and by our pradtife 
 we come to produce many effects, from the hidden and 
 mydical caufes, which are the effects, from theonely caufe 
 which is the onely matter, thus we come to finde the ufe of 
 Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, Vegetables, Minerals, and fo A- 
 nimal with Animal,and we do not onely get new acquaintance; 
 which is new experience, but we make ule of our acquaintance 
 to our own benefit, or at leaft we ltrive to do fo ; for it is the 
 nature of life, which life is innated matter, to drive for pre- 
 heminency, and abfolute power, that is, onely matter would 
 rule it felf, but beinginfinite it neither abfolutely knows it felf, 
 nor can abfolutely rule or govern it felf, and though it be an 
 endleffe work, yet motion which is the moving part of na- 
 ture, cannot defid, becaufe it is infinite, and eternal, thus mo- 
 ving matter running perpetually towards abfolute power, 
 makes a perpetual war , tor infinite, and onely matter is al- 
 wayes at drife for abfolute power, for matter would have 
 power over infinite, and infinite would have over matter, and 
 eternity would have power over both. 
 
 Thus infinit and eternal matter joyned all, as to one 
 is alwayes at drife in it felf, yet the war is regular, not 
 confufed ; For there this is a natural order, and difeipline is in 
 nature as much as cruel Tyrannie ; for there is a na- 
 tural! order, and difeipline often-times in cruel Ty- 
 ranny,

Chap. 77. Of different knowledge in different 
 
 figures. 
 
 C Ertainly there are infinite feveral kindes, as well as in- 
 finite feveral f^rts, and particular creatures in nature, and 
 certainly every feveral kinde, nay, every feveral fort in every 
 kinde. Knowledge works after a different manner; in every 
 different figure, which different manners we call particular 
 knowledges which works according to the figure, fo infinite 
 knowledge lies in infinite figure, and infinite figure in infinite 
 matter, and as there are infinite degrees of matter, fo there 
 are infinite degrees of knowledge, and as there are infinite de- 
 grees of knowledge, fo there are infinite degrees of motions, 
 to there are infinite degrees of figures, and as there are infi- 
 nite degrees, fo there are infinite kinds, and as there are infinite 
 kindes, fo there are infinite forts, and fo infinite particulars 
 in every fort, yet no kinde can be faid to have moft, or 
 leaft, though leffe or more ; for there is no fuch thing, as 
 moft or leaft in nature. For as I faid before, there isone- 
 ly different knowledge belonging to every kinde, as to Ani- 
 mal kinde, Vegetable kinde. Mineral kinde ; and infinite more 
 which we are not capable to know, but two particular forts 
 in every kinde ; as for example, Man may have a different 
 knowledge from beafts, birds, fifh, worms, and the like, and 
 yet be no wifer, or knowing then they ; For different 
 wayes in knowledge makes not knowledge more or leffe, no 
 more then different paths inlarge one compaffe of ground; 
 nor no more then feveral words for one and the fame thing, 
 for the thing is the fame,onely the words differ ; fo if a man 
 hath different knowledge from a fifh, yet the fifh may be as 
 knowing as man, but man hath not a fifties knowledge, nor a 
 fifh a mans knowledge. 
 
 Likewifefome creatures may have more, and fome lelfe 
 knowledge then others; yet none can be faid to have moft, 
 or leaft; for there is no fiich thing as moft or leaft in na- 
 ture, nor doth the weakneffe, or imperfe&ion in particular 
 
 That is to creatures impaire the knowledge of the kinde, or impair the 
 weaken the < knowledge as I may fay, belonging to any particular fort. 
 
 nor can any one have fuch a fupremacy of knowledge as to 
 add to the knowledge of the kinde, or fort of kinde, as to have 
 fuch a knowledge as is above the capacity of that kinde, or 
 fort to underftand. As for example, a man to know more 
 then the nature of man is to know; for what knowledge man 
 hath had, or can have, is in the capacity of the kinde, though 
 not to every particular man, for though nature may work with- 
 in her felf ; yet fhe cannot work beyond her felf, and if there 
 be mixe forts of creatures, as partly man, and partly beaft, 
 partly man, and partly fifh, or partly beaft, and partly fiih.

 and partly fifh, and partly foul 3 yet although they are mixt 
 creatures, and may have mixt knowledges, yet they are par- 
 ticular forts, and different knowledges, belonging to tnofe 
 forts, and though different forts have different knowledges, 
 yet the kinde may be of one and the fame degree 3 that is* 
 every feveral fort of creatures, in one and the fame kinde, 
 is as knowing and as wife, as another, and that which makes 
 fome creatures feem leffe perfect then others, or more know- 
 ing then others, is the advantage, or difadvantage of their 
 fhape, which gives one creature power over another 3 but 
 different Knowledg in different creatures takes advantages 
 by turns according as it turns to it. And as there is diffe- 
 rent Knowledge, and different Kinds, and feveral forts, fo 
 there is different Knowledge in different fenfes, in one and the 
 fame creature 3 for what man hath feen the interior biting mo- 
 tion of Gold, and burning motions of heat ? yet feels them 
 we may imagine by the touch, the interior nature of fire to 
 be compofed of {harp points, yet our fight hath no Knowledge 
 thereof, fo our fight hath the Knowledge of light 3 but the 
 reft of our fenfes are utterly ignorant thereof 3 our ears have 
 the Knowledge of found, but our eyes are ignorant of the 
 Knowledge thereof 3 thus, though our ears may be as Know- 
 ing as our eyes, and our eyes as Knowing as our ears, yet 
 they may be ignorant of each other, I fay Knowledge, for fenfe 
 is Knowledg, as well as reafon, onely reafon is a degree above 
 fenfe, or fenfe, a degree beneath reafon. 
 
 Chap, 78. The advantages of fome figures , fome de- 
 grees of matter , and motions , over others. 
 
 I F we do but ftricktly prie into the works of nature, we 
 fhall obferve, that all internal motions, are much after the 
 manner of external motions, 1 mean thofe motions that we 
 can perceive, by thofe effe&s, as are fubjedt to our fenfes,and 
 although forthemoft part the ftrongeft motions govern the 
 weakeft, yet it is not alwayes found that they conquer the 
 weaker 3 for there are infinite flights, or infinite advantages 
 to be taken, or mift in infinite nature, fome by the lhapes of 
 their figures, and fome in the degrees of matter, and fome 
 in the manner of moving 3 for flights are juft like the actions 
 of Juglers, Vauters, or Tumblers, Wraftlers, or the like; 
 for fhapes I will give one or two for example, as a little 
 Moufe which is but a weak creature, in comparifon to an Ele- 
 phant, yet the fmall Moufe fhall overcome an Elephant, by 
 running up through the fnout, and fo get into the head, and fo 
 gnaw on his*brain 3 And a Worm is a weak creature in com- 
 parifon of a man, yet if he get into the guts, it will gnaw 
 out his bowels, and deftroy that figure. So for degrees of

 part of matter, and for motions, moft often the nimbler, 
 and agile motions, get an advantage on the ftronger, if 
 more {lower, and oftener by the manner of motions; for 
 many times a diving motion will have the better ofaiwim- 
 ming motion, a jumping motion of a running motion, a cree- 
 ping or crawling motion , of either, a darting motion of a 
 flying motion, acroffe motion of a ftraight motion, a tur- 
 ning motion of a lifting motion, fo an Attra&ive motion of an 
 expulfive motion, and infinite the like, and every motion may 
 have their advantages by turns, and then the advantages of

 Chap. 79. Of the figurative fgures. 
 
 M Oft figures are lined, and enterlined, ^s I may fay, 
 for expreffion fake, fome figures are like a fet, or neft 
 Of boxes, as for example, half a dozen boxes one within a- 
 nother, fo every of thole figures hath the fame figure, within 
 one another, the outermoft figure being the largeft, the in- 
 moft figure the leaft; as for example, a man builds a houfe, 
 firft he builds the figure of that houfe with wood, as beams, 
 and rafters and lathes ; next he laies morter, then is the fi- 
 gure of that houfe in morter, then he laies bricks or ftones, 
 then there is the figure of the houfe in done, and brick, then 
 it is plaiftered within the infide, then there is the figure of 
 the houfe in plaifter, if it be painted, then there is figure of 
 the houfe ill painting; fo likewifean Animal, as a man, firft 
 there is the figure of a man in bones, as we may fee in a 
 Anatomie, then there is the figure of a man in flefh;thirdly 
 there is the figure of a man in the skin, then there are many, 
 different figures, belonging to one and the fame figure, as 
 every feveral part of an Animal is of a different figure, 
 and every part hath different figures belonging thereunto ; as 
 man for example, to the hand there is the palm, the back, 
 the fingers, the nailes, yet all makes but one hand. 
 
 So the head, there is the brain,the pia mater, the dura mater, 
 the fcul, the nofe, the eyes, the fore-head, the ears, the mouth, 
 the lips, the tongue, the chin, yet all this is but a head; like- 
 wile the head, the neck, the bred, the arms, the hinds, the back, 
 the hips, the bowels, the thighes, the legs, the feet; befides, 
 the bones, the nerves, the mufcles, the veins, the arteries, the 
 heart, the liver, the lights, the midrif, the bladder, thekidnies,

the guts 3 the ftomacke, the train , the marrow, the 
 blood, the flefh, the skin* yet all thefe different figurative 
 parts make but the figure of one irfan. So for ^Vegetables, 
 the root, the fap,the peath, the bole, the bark, the branches, 
 n^ke but . the figure of one tree } like wife every figure is 
 <pJe5ren.t,.tHis man is not like that man, this tree is not like that 
 tree, for fonfe trees are larger, or ieffer, hitter, or lower, 
 more or leffe branched, crooked,, of ftragiiter , fo in Ani- 
 mals, fame are of one fhape, iome of another, as; men, fome 
 are flender and tall } fome little and low 5 fome big arid taj.1. 
 Gibers thick and low 5 fome high-nofid } fome flat-nofid} fome 
 thick, fome thin lipt* fome high fore-heads, fome low, fome. 
 broad, fome narrow, and numbers of like examples may be 
 given, not onely to man, but all other Animal creatures ac- 
 cording to their fhapes , that every particular in one and the 
 fame kinde, hath different figures, yet, every particular kinde 
 hath but one and the lame motion, which properly and na- 
 turally belong to that Kinde of figure, as a horle to gallop, 
 to amble, to trot, to runn, to leap, to kick, and the like^and 
 man to lift, to -carry to walk, to run, to pitch, to dig, to fhut, 
 to chop, to pull back, to thruft forward} likewife every parti- 
 cular part in one and the fame Kinde, hath but one and the 
 fame kinde of motions, local or otherwife, and ever particu- 
 lar bird, hath but one, and the fame kinde of motion in their 
 flights, and in their feeding} 
 
 . So beafts,. every particular kinde hath, but one and the fame 
 manner of motion, and feeding} fo likewife all mankinde hath 
 after one and the fame Kinde of motions belonging naturally 
 to every particular part of his body, the onely difference is 
 in the ftrength, or weakneffe, their reflraints or facilities 
 but not different in manner of the movings. But to return, 
 to the figures, I fay there are different figures belonging to one 
 and the lame kinde of figure, but the ground or funda- 
 mental figures in every particular figure, are there. (As for 
 example) a tree atfirftis the figure of wood, the fecond is 
 fuch- a fort of wood, as a Cedar, an Oak, an Elm, an Afh, and 
 the like } alfo of fuch a nature of wood, fome fitter to burn 
 then to build, others that will grow but on fuch,or fuch foils, o- 
 thers to laft longer, or die fooner, or bud and bear in fuch, and 
 fuchfeafons, fome to bear fruit, others to bear none. 
 
 Likewife for Animals, the firft figure is to be an Animal, 
 that is, to have a local figure, the fecond figure is to be flefh, 
 not wood. The third is to be fuch a kinde of flefh as mans 
 flefh, not bears flefh, or dogs flefh, or horfe flefh, or cows 
 flefh, and more examples maybe given, then lam able to 
 repeat, or my book to infold, but Animals and Vegetables 
 have more different figures, belonging to every particular, fi- 
 gure or Kinde then Minerals, efpecially metals, which are as it 
 were compofed of one piece.

 A Yreis not a fhining body of it felf, but as the lines of 
 light fhine upon it, it is fmooth, and may be agloflie 
 body, but not a fhining ; for though there are infinite feveral 
 forts of brightnelfe and fhining, yet two I will defer ibe. 
 
 As there are two forts of fhining figures ; fome that caft 
 forth beams of light, as bright fhining fire, and likewife 
 from fome forts of ftones, bones, and wood, fo there are fome 
 forts of figures that onely retain a bright fhining quality in 
 themfelves,but caft forth no beams there-from 5 or elfe fo weak 
 and fmall, as not ufefulto our fight, but what is reprefented 
 to us thereon, by other lights ; this fort is water, metal , and 
 vulgar ftones, which perchance ayremay have fuch a fhining 
 body. 
 
 Thefe fhining bodies, as water, or metal , or the like, are 
 not perceived in the dark, but when light is caft thereon, we 
 do not onely perceive the light, but their own natural fhining 
 quality by that light. 
 
 Again, fome figures have onely a gloffe, which is a faint 
 fhining, like as a iained light, or an eclipfed fhadow, as all 
 the pores Vegetables, and Animals skins have; and fome fi- 
 gures are gloffy through the thinneffe, or t^anfparentneffe, not 
 in the nature, for by reafon the figure is thin, and tranfpa- 
 rent, the light fhining, though tranfparent doth not onely 
 fhew the light, but the light gives thofe figures a gloffe. 
 
 Some figures, as I have laid,are as it were all of one piece, as 
 fome forts of earth, water, vapor, and ayr, which may be me- 
 tamorphofed, by contracting and dilation. 
 
 Others of divers pieces ,and feveral works, as Vegetables,

 mean fear ching, and penetrating, which in fome lenfe makes 
 it equal, if there be equality in infinite, but the innating mat- 
 ter works not upon the dull matter, as upon a new material; 
 for the innate matter is mixt with the dull part of matter ;

 For the innated matter moves in the dull part of / matter, and 
 on the dull part of matter, as I have defcribed in my firft part, 
 for the innated matter takes not frefh and new (as I may 
 fay) for diftin&ion fake, to make a figure with 5 but turns 
 the dull matter into feveral figures, joyning each degree as the 
 innate matter will, or as it is proper tor fuch a kinde of 
 figure, for fome degrees of matter will not make, I do beleeve 
 fome kinde of figures, but the dull part of matter, is not mixed 
 in the innate matter, although the innate matter is mixed in 
 that, for the innate matter is pure in it (elf, without any grofs 
 mixture, for it is the infinite pure part of matter infinite, it is 
 the fpirits, or effence of nature.

 A LL Created, or not created, or created, and diffol- 
 ved again, figures or forms, lie in onely matter, either 
 in by parts, or in the whole, for the materials of every figure 
 is but of one matter, and the lump of all figures is the figure 
 of eternal matter, for the infinite particular of figures, is the 
 infinite form, fhape, or figure of infinite and eternal matter, 
 and the creation, difpofals, and diffolvings of figures, are the 
 feveral a&ions of that onely matter ; for infinite motions are 
 the infinite life, of the infinite and eternal life, which life, 
 is as eternal matter, being part of the matter it felf, and the 
 manner of moving is but the feveral a&ions of life ; for it is 
 not an abfence of life when the figure diffolves, but an alte- 
 ration of life, that is, the matter ceafeth not from moving, 
 for every part hath life in it, be the parts never fo fmall. Or 
 difperft amongft other parts, and it life, there muff be con- 
 fequently fenfe, if fenfe, knowledge , then there can be no 
 death, if every part hath life in it, fo that which we call 
 death, is onely an alteration of fuch motions, in fuch a figure,

 but fo as partly the intellect changes, with the fhape and in- 
 terior form, but all bodies are in the way of tranfmigrations 
 perpetually.

 dung into earth, earth into Vegetables, Vegetables into A- 
 nimals ; again by the way of food, and likewife Animals 
 into Animals, and Vegetables into Vegetables, and fo likewife 
 the elements. 
 
 But indeed all creatures are created by the way of tranf- 
 migration. 
 
 As for example, hens, or other fouls lay eggs, and then 
 lit on them, from whence a nourifhing heat is tranfinigrated 
 from the hen into the eggs, which tranl'migrates into a kinde 
 of a Chylus, then into blood, blood into ilelh, flefh into fi- 
 news, finews into bones, and fome into veines, arteries, brains, 
 and the like. 
 
 For tranfmigration is onely the mixing fifting, fearching, 
 temping faculty, of innated matter, which is felf-motion, 
 and (motion is the onely tranlmigrater,' other wife infinite 
 matter would lie idle eternally, though I cannot well con- 
 ceive how infinite can be without motion 3 but ho whoever 
 WC perceive fo much as there are proper motions, and mix- 
 tures of matter belonging to every particular figure; 
 and though figures doth produce figures , yet figures do 
 not order, the creation, for it is not the figures that 
 cmate , but; creation that produceth by figures, which 
 creation is motion, which motion is inoated matter, which 
 matter creates and dilfolves by the way of transmigrations, all 
 figures dilfolving to create, and creates to diffolve, but dif- 
 l'oiving, and creation, which is that we call life and death, 
 hath onely a reference to the figures, but not of the nature 
 of the matter.

 to add fomething more, or take away , and make all lefle, oi: 
 thicker, or thinner, or higher or lower; but cannot alter 
 the interior form, which is the foundations, but if they pull 
 it down, the fame materials may be put into another form, 
 or into the fame form it was at firft, but it muft firft be new 
 built again, before it can have thofe forms, and they muft 
 ftay the time of building; fo for every Vegetable creature, 
 and Animal creature, they cannot be metamorphded , by 
 the reafon metamorphofmg is to change their forms without 
 a new creation, and they cannot change their forms without 
 a diffolution, and then created anew, by reafon the intellect, 
 and the interior form is as one body, and not to be fepa- 
 rated ; for the interior forms of thele creatures, and the intel- 
 lects depend upon one another, and without one the pother 
 cannot be. 
 
 The intellect, and the interior form may be divided toge- 
 ther into parts; but not feparated apart, though the feveral 
 forts of one and the fame kinde, as Animal kinde may be 
 mixed in their creations, as to be fome part a beaft, lome 
 part a dog, or the like, and part a man, and fome creature 
 partly a bird, and partly a beaft, or partly a beaft and part- 
 ly a fifti ; yet the intellect is mixt with the interior form, 
 and the exterior fhape with the interior form. 
 
 The like in vegetables, and if the interior forms, and in- 
 tellects of each fQrt, nay of each creature, cannot be changed,- 
 much leffe of each kinde, thus the intellect natures, and inte- 
 rior forms of it, can never be without a new creation, and as 
 for the exterior lhapesof Animals may be altered but not 
 changed ;»Jor Animals of all other creatures have their fhapes 
 moft unite to the interior form, and $rbri> intellect nature of a- 
 ny other creature in nature. 
 
 But I defire my readers not to miftake me, for want of 
 terms, and words of Art. 
 
 For the interior or intellect nature I mean is fuch properties, 
 difpofition , conftitution. Capacity, and the like; that makes 
 it luch a creature. 
 
 , 1 . , \ • 
 
 The interior form is fuch a fubftance, and fuch a fort as 
 flefh, or fffh, or wood, or metal, and not onely fo, but fuch a 
 fort of flefh, as mans-flefh, horfe-flefh, dogs-flefh, and the 
 like. 
 
 So the wood of oak, the wood of maple, the wood of 
 afh; And the like, fo the gold metal, the iron metal, and 
 the like. 
 
 For horfe-flefh is not mans-flefh, nor the wood of oak, the 
 wood of afh, nor the metal of gold, the metal of iron. 
 
 And as for the exterior form, I mean the outward 
 fhape.

 Chap. 85. The Metamorfbofing of the exterior forms y 
 of fome figures. 
 
 A LL figures that are of a united piece, as water and- 
 fire are, and not in parts, as not having 1 feveral parts or 
 different natures, as Animals and Vegetables have, may be 
 Metamorphofed out of one form into another, and rechange 
 into the original form again, yet it is onely their exterior 
 form, not their interior nature. As for example, water that 
 Which circular 1S ^ r0zen 3 or turned to hail, or fnow, the exterior is onely me- 
 lines ljbai ex- tamorphofed jFor the interior nature which is the circular line 
 pretfe hereof- is unaltered, likewife when the circular line is extenuated into 
 air, the" interior circle lise is not changed^ but when the inte- 
 rior nature is diflolved, and the matter it was compoled of 
 tranfmigrates into other figures. 
 
 Likewife metals when the interior nature is changed,it can- 
 not be rechanged again without a new creation; for if we can 
 turn onemetal into another, yet xt is not as the way of metamor- 
 phofing, but tranfmigrating, otherwayes we may lay, we can 
 turn Animals and Vegetables into water, when we didil them, 
 but the magick of Chymiftry fhall nor return them to their in- 
 terior nature, nor exterior fhape. Again, although their defires 
 make them beleeveit poflible to be done, but fubftra&ing 
 > .e is not metamorphofing, but rather tranfmigrating, and fub- 
 
 dra&ingis one of the chiefed faculties of tranfmigration. 
 
 And as for thofe creatures that are compofed of parts of 
 different natures (as I have faid) their exterior form cannot 
 be metamorphofe d,becaufe thofe motions that metamorphofe 
 one part, cannot meta^Srpiofe another. 
 
 And though every part is different, yet they generally unite to 
 the confidence of the whole figure, whereby the feveral tranf- 
 forming motions on the feveral parts would make fuch a con- 
 fufion, as upon neceifity mull diffolve the intellect nature, 
 and interior form of that particular figure, thus driving to 
 alter would deftroy.

 ryiay anfwer, that there is no Art nor Science, but 
 is produced thereby, if they will Without parti- 
 ality confider from whence they are derived.

 I anfwer, that it is impoffible that nature fhould 
 perfe&ly underftand, and ablolutly know her felf, 
 becaufe the is infinite, much lefle can any of her 
 works know her. 
 
 Yet it doth not follow, that nothing can be 
 known, becaufe all is not known. 
 
 As for example, there are feveral parts of the world 
 difcovered,yet it is moft likely not all, nor may be 
 never fhall be, yet moft think that the whole world 
 is found, becaufe Drahg, and Cavendijb went in a 
 circular line until they came to the place where they 
 fet out at firft. And I am moft confident that moft of 
 all thought alLthe world was known unto them 
 before the Weffilndies were difcovered,and the man 
 which difeoveredit in his brain befoie he had tra- 
 velled on the navigable fea, and offered it to King 
 Henry the feventh, who flighted him as a foolifh 
 fellow, not beleeving his intelligence, and no quefti- 
 on there were many that laughed at him, as a vain 
 fool, others pitied him, as thinking him mad, and 
 others fcorned him, as a cheating fellow, which 
 would have couzened the King of England of a 
 fum of money; but the Queen of Portugal being 
 wifer then^reft impjoyed him, and adventured 
 a great fuifime of money to fet him forth on his 
 way, which when the fuccefle was according to 
 the mans Genius brain, and had brought the Queen 
 by the difeovery, gold and filver mines for her 
 Coine, then all other nations envied the King of 
 Spain who was heir, and like a company of dogs 
 which fight for a bone, went together by the 
 ears, tobefharers with him. 
 
 So the Bifhop,who declared his opinion, of the An- 
 tipodes, was not onely cryeddown, and exclaimed 
 againftby the vulgar which hates all ingenuity, but 
 learned Scholers ftood up againft him, and the great 
 and grave Magiftrates condemned him as an Atheift 
 for that opinion, and for that reafon put him from 
 his Bifhoprick, and though he had favour to fpare

 Navigators, but the ignorant 8c unpra&ifed brains, 
 think all impoffible that is unknown unto them. 
 
 But put the cafe many went about to finde 
 that which can never be found (as. they (aid natu- 
 ral Philofophy is)yet they might finde in the fearch 
 that they did not expe&, which might prove very 
 beneficial to them; or put the cafe ten thoufand 
 fiiould go ten thoufand wayes tofeek for a cabinet 
 of precious Jewels, and all fhould miffeofitbut 
 one, (hall that one befcorned and laughed at for 
 his good fortune, or in duftry? this were agreatin- 
 juftice. 
 
 But ignorance and envy ftrives to take off the 
 glofie of truth, if they cannot wholy overthrow 
 it ; and thofe that write muff arm themfelves with 
 negligence againfi: cenfure* 
 
 For my part I do, for I verily beleeve, that ig- 
 norance and prefent envie will flight my book $ 
 yet I make no queftion, when envy is worn 
 out by time, but undemanding will remember me 
 in after ages, when I am changed from this life • but 
 I had rather live in a general remembrance, then in 
 a particular life.

 then this folid format becomes pores, and the

 makes it mud, when it extends further then the degree of 
 mud, it turns to a fofter form, as that of {lime j the fourth 
 extenuating degree fhapes it into a perfect ring drawing all 
 the looie parts into a compaffe line, this becomes water, and 
 the difference of a lump, or ball of earth to the watry circle, 
 for a round lump is when there is nofpace, or diftind lines, 
 and a circular ring is a diftindt line with a hollow center, 
 that is, an empty place, in the midftofa round line, fo they 
 may be a round ball, but not a ring, or a round circle line, 
 and a circle line and not a ball, and as I faid, when it comes 
 tofuch a degree, of extenuating, it turns water, that is, to 
 be wet, liquid and fluid, and according as the circles are, 
 is the water more or leffe, and according as the. lines are 
 extenuated, or contra&ed, is the water thicker or thinner, 
 colder or hotter, heavier or lighter, and according as the litjfes 
 are round, or flat-edge, pointed, or fmooth, is the water frdft, 
 fharp, fait, or bitter, but thefe circles may not onely dilate,' 
 and contract feveral wayes, but after feveral fafhions, as to 
 makewapor, air, fire, fnow, hail, ice, and froft, as I {flail de- 
 clare in my following chapters.

 W E may perceive that whatfoever is hot and dry, and 
 cold and dry, (brinks inward as towards the center, 
 and whatsoever is hot and moift, and cold and moift, dilates 
 as towards the circumference, fo that all moifture is wrought 
 by extenuating motions, and drought, by contracting motions, 
 and not onely extenuating motions, but fuch forts of extenu- 
 ating motions,and drought by contracting motions,and notonely

 make it fmooth, the figures having no end extenuating makes 
 it ioftby fpreading and loofing the parts, as flowing by rea- 
 fon dilations drive all outward as toward the circumference 
 yet the degree of extenuating may out-run the degree of 
 wet ; for wet is in fuch a degree of extenuating circles as X 
 may fay, the middle degree, yet there are many forts of wet, 
 as oylie,wet, and watry; but I have defcribed that in my 
 chapter of oyl, but I take oyl rather to be liquid and moift, 
 then wet ; For there is difference betwixt moift, liquid, and 
 vy.et, for though moift and liquid is in a degree of wet, yet 
 it is not an ablolute wet, for diffolved gums are liquid, not 
 wet, melted Sugers are liquid, not wet, oyl is more liquid 
 then wet, and fmoakmay be faid to be liquid, as being of an 
 oyly nature, and air rather to be moift then wet, and duft, 
 Afhes, flame, light, winde, may be faid to be fluid, but not 
 liquid nor wet. 
 
 Chap. 88. Of Circles. 
 
 A Circle is a round figure without ends, having a circum- 
 ference, and a center , and the figure of a circle, may be 
 many wayes contracted, but can be but in one way extenua- 
 ted, which is by inlarging the compaffe, of the line; and the 
 reafon is, becaufe it is a round piece, without ends ; for a 
 ftraight line may be drawn out at either end ; but if a circle 
 be drawn out of the compaffe, it may ftretch out of the one 
 fide, but it will pull in the other fide after it, unleffe the 
 line be broke, and then it is no longer a circle , thus we can 
 extend no part out, but another part muft contra# to give 
 way to that part that goeth out.

 Chap. 89. Of Soft nefje. 
 
 A LL that is wett is foft, I mean that which is naturally 
 wet- but all that is loft is not wet, as hair, wool, feathers, 
 and the like. 
 
 Likewife all that is foft or wet is made by extenuating 
 motions $ now fome may ask me, why extenuating motions 
 fhould caufe figures to be foft, more then any other i I an- 
 fwcr, firft, that all extentions caufeth poroufnefle, or fpungi- 
 nefle, by ipreading orloofing parts, and all that are po- 
 rous tend to hollo wne fie, and all that is hollow tends 
 to flacknefie, and all that are porous hollow, and flack 
 tend to foftnefle 3 for we may perceive whatloever figure is 
 porous, is not fo firm, ftrong, nor hard, as thofe which are 
 clofe compact 3 for that which hath no Vacuum, or Conveni- 
 ent diftance, hath not fo much Liberty, as that which hath Va- 
 cuum ; for Vacuum is fpace and difiance betwixt parts, which 
 gives thofe parts liberty to move, and remove, and that which 
 hath mo ft liberty is moft loofe, and that ^which ismoftloofe 
 is leaft contracted, and that which is leaft contracted, is moft 
 pliant, and that which is moft pliant is foft. But I defire 
 my Readers would not miftake me, for as there is hard,foft, 
 light, heavy, thick, thin, quick, flow, belonging to the nature 
 of the onely infinite matter, fo there are belonging to fuch 
 lhapes, or figures made by the working of the infinite moti- 
 ons making infinite figures out of infinite matter j but the dif- 
 ference is , that what is in the nature cannot be altered, but 
 what is done by the working of motions may be undone again, 
 for the etfeds may alter, but not the caufe $ thus motion and 
 figure, or figure by motion may altej, but not the nature of 
 the matter ; For motion and figure are but the effeCfs of the 
 onely and infinite matter &c. 
 
 Chap. 90. Of Liquors. 
 
 A LL liquors are wrought by extenuating motions, and 
 all that is liquid and wet, are circles extenuated to fuch 
 a degree, and after fuch a manner , and all that are liquid

 oyls, vitrals, ftrong-waters, all juices from fruits, herbs, or the 
 like, or any thing that is liquid and wet } but though all that is 
 liquid and wet naturally agree in extenuating circles, yet thier 
 circle lines are different, which caufeth the different effeCls, 
 for fome have different effeCts interiorly, others exteriorly, 
 and fome both interiorly, and exteriorly, for fome have cir- 
 cular lines of points, others have circular lines pointed, others

 And infinite more that I know not how to describe ; But thele 
 lines, nor circle points, nor edges, are not fubjeClto ourfen- 
 fes, although their effects may make them fubjeCt to our $ea- 
 fon, for nature works beyond our fenfe, but reafon is part of 
 thefenfeof nature; but of all wet liquors oyl is moft diffe- 
 rent from the effects of water, for all other wet liquors do 
 ftrive to quench fire, but oyl doth attift it, yet all vitrals have 
 an exterior burning faculty, which oyl hath not, and although 
 all ftrong wet liquors will flame when it is let on fire, yet 
 they will quench out fire, if enough be caft thereon. 
 
 Chap. pi. The extention and contraction of circles. 
 
 T He nature of extention ftrives to get ground, that is, 
 fpace, or compaffe, and to difperfe, or level parts as it 
 were, and the nature of contraction ftrives to thruft out fpace 
 and compaffe, and to thruft up parts clofe together , and this 
 is the reafon that a circle may contract fo many feveral 
 wayes, becaufe contraction flings out the compaffe, and 
 makes ufe of the line, laying the line into millions of feveral 
 works. 
 
 And yet the exterior form which is the circular line, be 
 one and the fame, that is, the circular line is not divided, but 
 when thofe works are undone, and the line extended to the full 
 compaffe, it receives the original form, which is a round 
 circle ; for as they were contracted without breaking the 
 circle, fo they may be extended into a circle again. 
 
 Likewife the circular forms may be wrought with mixt mo- 
 tions, as partly by contraction, and partly by extenuation, 
 as when a round circle is wound about a ftaff,or pole, or 
 the like ; for though the winding about the ftaff be a 
 contracting motion, or at leaft one way, which is when it 
 draws inward, as towards the center, yet by winding it length- 
 way es, or upward, is a kincle of an extenuation. 
 
 Likewife,a circle or fmoak when it curls in rings, before 
 the circle break, as we fhall oft times fee it doth contract, 
 as folding and half curling, fo it extenuates as it fpreadsand 
 weares out. Likewife take a round firing, that is, joyn the two 
 ends, and put this circular firing double, and then winde it 
 ferpentine wayes, and the like, and though the winding, or 
 twitting about is contracting, yet winding or twitting one 
 ring betore another is extenuating. 
 
 Here have I fet down after what manner of wayes are con- 
 tracted, or continuated circles, and thus millions of feveral 
 
 works

 works may by circles be wrought, and feveral figures made 
 thereof; Like wife for circular lines, fome may be broad, 
 fome narrow, fome rouud, fome flat, fome edged, fome 
 twifted, but thofe that are flat are moft apt to be edged. 
 
 Likewile there may be circle lines with fmooth lines, 
 fome pointed, fome checkred, fome twifted, fome braided, and 
 the like. 
 
 But although the circle compaffe is perfect, yet the line is 
 not a perfect Circular compaffe, becaufe the roughneffe makes 
 it uneven. Thus as 1 have faid before , milions of changes may 
 be in circles, but perchance fome will fay, it is no longer a cir- 
 cle, when it is turned fquare, or triangular-wayes , or the 
 like. 
 
 I anfwer, it is a circle fquared, but not a circle broke, for as 
 long as the circle is whole, the interior nature is not diffolved, 
 let the exterior figure be after what manner it will or can; for 
 ft ill it is a natural circle, although it be put into a Mathematical 
 - fquare, or the like; fo thofe exterior figures, are but chan- 
 ged fhapes, not the natural form, but a natural fquare is to 
 have four diftinCt lines, and a triangle three diftinCt lines, and 
 a cupe fix, as I take it, or fixteen ; but it is to be obferved, that 
 all thofe figures that naturally are made of one piece, without 
 diftinCt parts, or feveral tempered matter,may change,and re- 
 change their fhapes, and yet keep their own interiour nature 
 intire, that is the nature proper to fuch a figure ; but thofe 
 figures that are made ol many diftinCt parts, or feveral tem- 
 pered matter, would make fuch a confufion in their transfor- 
 mations, as would ruin the intire foundations. 
 
 Chap. 92. Of congealed water. 
 
 W Ater is not alwayes exteriorly wet, or fluid, as we 
 may fee alwayes when it is congealed to fnow, ice,and 
 hail, yet ft ill it is water, keeping the interior nature of being 
 wet and fluid, onely the cold contractions have, as may fay, 
 altered the face or countenance thereof ; for it is to be obfer- 
 ved, as there are extenuating motions, thrufting and ftretching, 
 inlarging further and wider out in compaffe, bredth, length, 
 and depth, as from the center to the circumference, fo there are 
 contracting motions together, draw winde, twift and pull in, 
 as from the circumference to the center, and not onely by 
 interior motions, but exterior motions; as for example, cold 
 contraction upon water circles, or any thing that is poroUs 
 and fpungie, draws, and gathers them into feveral works, or 
 draws them into a leffe compaffe, as firings do a purfe, or 
 likefifhers or faulkners nets. . ■ 
 
 But fnow, hail, and froft, and ice is made .by a level con- 
 tract ion, as if a Circular line fhould belaid upon a flat .ground, 
 and be drawn a particular work, as for example,, according 
 
 Ka to 
 


## p. 60 (#88) ##############################################

to the number of watry circles, there is fueh a quantity of 
 water, and if the quantity of water be more then the ftrength 
 of the cold contraction, it is frozen more or Idle, now the 
 feveral- figures which cold contraction draws to make fnow, 
 hail, ice, and froft, are after this manner, as firft the interior 
 nature of the water is a round circle like a ring. 
 
 When it contracts into hail, the exterior figure contracts 
 into a ball, or lump, as if one fhould winde up a double line, 
 or thread into a bundle, or bottom. 
 
 Snow is made by contraction, as if one fhould draw a 
 round line into a three fquare figure, as triangular way. 
 
 Ice, as if we fhould draw a round line into a four lquare fi- 
 gure, as after a cupe way. 
 
 Froft is made by fuch contracting motions, as if a round 
 line fhould be drawn into a furfling, as a crackling figure. 
 
 When this congealed cold thaws, it is either by the inte- 
 rior ftrength of dilating motions, or by an exterior heat that 
 draws thefe contractions out into fmooth extenuating circles' 
 again. 
 
 Thus circular lines may be drawn from the round compaffe, 
 to be four fquare, three lquare, or length-way es , as one would 
 clap the brim of ones hat together $ and millions of feveral 
 works, and never divide the circular lines, but I will not 
 fay by a M^thematicall rule, though nature is beyond our 
 learning. 
 
 And that which makes ice and hail more fhining then 
 froft, and fnow, is, that the lines are evener • for all figures 
 that are compofed by the way of lines, are apt tofhine, and 
 thofe figures that have feweft points, or ends are imoo- 
 theft. 
 
 Now fome may fay, or ask,why I fhould think (how is made 
 triangular waycs ? My reaion is, becaufe it feems rougher, and 
 not fb united as ice, or hail, which fhews the interior figure 
 hath more points, or unevener numbers, or unequal lines, 
 and a triangular figure is not fo fmooth, or at leaft feems not 
 fo,as a circular, a paralel, or cupe $ for in the angulars the 
 points an,d lines are odd, and the lines run flope-wayes, 
 whereas c the figure of a cupe, although it hath more points, 
 yet the figure is more proportionable, by the even number of 
 the points and lines 5 lor as there are four points, fo there are 
 four equal Tines, which make an equal number, when in the 
 figure Of a triangular The points and lines are odd j for though 
 there are a plural' number, yet it is an uneven number, as 
 being odd. And as I have f aid, the lines are Hope when the 
 figure Of a cupe is juft fquare, befides triangular points be- 
 ing odd, multiplie and fubftract by reflections, aswefhall 
 fee by triangular glades, that from one face millions are 
 made % thbdiyi^ings. Thus what is made uneven by odd 
 numbers, arfimade even by equal numbers, and the odd points,

 and (lope lines, make the figure of fnow rough, and Une- 
 qual points, and ftraight lines make the figure of ice Smooth, 
 but I treat here of exterior figures, of rather countenances^ 
 not of the interior form, for their contractions change the 
 exteriors, not the interiors. : ^ 
 
 But if 1 be out, and miftake, either in termes of art, or o- 
 therwife, I muft intreat my readers to pardon it, for I am no 
 Mathematician, onely I have gathered here and there fome 
 little parcels or crums from the difcourfe of my friends, for

 fore it came to fuch a degree, it became more and more wet, 
 as from being pores to foft, from foft to liquid, from liquid From earth 
 to wet, likewile from wet to moift, from moift to thin, which to water, 
 thin is air. 
 
 But when the extenuating lines come to fuch a degree of ( 
 fmalnefle, as to cut, as a very final line will do, which is to 
 fuch a degree, as to be (harp as an edge, it makes it in a degree 
 towards burning fire, fo far as to become lulphury hot, as we 
 know by the fenfe of feeling, we finde the' air to be hot. This 
 fort of air which is made of watry circles, is like feething hot. t 
 water, for it is a moift heat, and not like the natural air, for. 
 this is but a Metamorpholed air, for the interior nature q£ ^ 
 water is undiffolved, onely the exterior is altered, the lines;, 
 being become fmall and edged, by the fair extenuations, but i

 are quick, or flow,it is fooner or longer turning out of one fhape 
 into another, and if any of the circular lines break by other 
 motions or figures before it corns to the furtheft extention, 
 the quantity becomes leffe wafting that matter into figures 
 of other natures, being diffolved from that natural figure; thus 
 that ball, or lump may be diffolved, like as Animals, or the 
 like; For no queftion thefe balls are created and diffolved as 
 Animal kinde, and are as numerous as other creatures, and 
 fome lafting longer then others, and fome diffolving fooner; 
 though their creations are different, one being produced by 
 procreation, the other by extenuation; thus thefe elements 
 are increafeable, and decreafeable , and other creature are ; 
 and when the interior nature is altered, it diffolves as other 
 creatures do, onely the exterior with the interior diffolves, 
 which moft of other creatures do not, for when the interi- 
 or is altered in Animals, the exterior is perfect , and diffolves 
 more by degrees. 
 
 Chap. 94 . Of 0)1, 
 
 O Y L is partly of the nature of fire, and par tly of the na- 
 ture of water; for as it is fofr, fluid, liquid, andmoift, 
 it is of the nature of water; as it is hot burning and fiamable, 
 it is of the nature of fire, for that which makes it Audi and j 
 liquid, is by extenuations, and that which makes it moift and 
 liquid is by extenuating circles, and that which makes it burning, 
 is, thatthofe circular lines are compofed of pointed parts, 
 which when fire and oyl meets, the Are breaking thofe lines 
 a funder, fets thofe pointed parts at liberty, which caufeth it 
 fo rife in a flame, and the realon why it flames, is, that it doth 
 not fuddenly lofe the circular extenuating nature; for flame is 
 fomewhat of the nature of water, as being fluid, though not 
 wet, and the reafon why flame is fluid, is, becaufe it afeerids in 
 a circular motion, for though the afeent be in a ftridt parrelled 
 line, yet the matter is after a circular figure, as a hollow 
 fpungy body, as after this manner or the like, which fhuts up- 
 ward, like an arrow out of a bow, onely imagining the arrow 
 to be in ferpentine * fhape, and to turn and (pin about as it af- 
 cends, likewife the body to extend for fpread outward, accor- 
 ding to the bulk or quantity, which feveral figures, or feveral 
 motions, may be all at one time, and in one and the fame 
 thing, and work to one and the fame effect, and to feveral ef- 
 fects at the fame time , which caufeth it to be fluid, liquid, and 
 light, for light as well as oyl, water, or flame, is fluid, caufed

 by extenuating motions, for as water will run forward when 
 it hath liberty, or run backward in a torrent when it is ftopt, 
 fo light will enter when it hath paflage, or run back by re- 
 flection it it be ftopt, but all thofe fluidities are different by 
 reaton their extenuations are different ; For light is cauled by 
 fwift extenuating paralel lines ; water, oyl, and the like by 
 extenuating circular lines, which make it moift, and liquid, 
 as well as fluid, but flame takes part from all, for it is light 
 and fluid -by the fwift extenuating parallel lines, it afcendsin, f 
 and liquid, although not wet, by the circular motions it af- 
 cends up in, and burning by the fharp parts it is compofed of; 
 vitjal is after the fame nature of oyl, onely the lines are or rather like ‘ 
 edged , as a knife, or the like, or fharp edged tools, which flarne * 
 make it have an exterior prefling quality, as burning fire 
 hath 5 but the exterior ofoylie lines are fmooth, which makes 
 it foft, and glib, and not fo fharp and penetrating as vitrals, or 
 the like are. 
 
 Thus flame, light, oyl, fire vitrals,waters, have mixt motions, 
 to make one figure, and many figures, to make thofe figures 
 which make them to be of mixt qualities producing mixt ef- 
 fects, as indeed all effects are of a mixt nature. 
 
 Chap. 9 5. Of Metals* 
 
 A LL Metals are created after the manner of circle lines, 
 as water,onely the lines in metal are cpntraCted, as draw- 
 ing inwards, and water circle lines are Extended outward, 
 but in aii metals the circle lines are flat, and edged, having 
 a cutting and afubdividing nature, and by reafon theexteri- 
 our nature is of a circle figure , it is apt to be fluid , and to 
 flow as water doth, when the exterior is melted by forcible 
 motions, then it is one, as that of fire, which draws out the 
 contracted circles of metals, caufing it to be fluid by exten- 
 tion, yet the extention is not natural, as it is in water, but for- 
 ced by an over-powerful motion ; for the nature of metal is 
 not to be fluid, which is the reafon that affoon as it can get 
 libertie, that is, when the moer ftrong motions let- go their 
 hold, it contracts into a firm and hard body : again, it breaks ®ai creature 
 not the interior circle, for then the nature alters, for as much ^“Jdand 
 as metals lofeth in the weight , fo much is changed of that dragged^: 
 quantity, from the natural quality, and though fome metals of ns natural 
 do not, waft in quantity, which is to change in quality, fo loon gar ’ 
 as others, yet they are all diflolvable, although fome fay gold 
 is not diflolvable; but fure that opinion proceeds from impa- 
 tience in man-kinde, not to ftay the time, or rather for want 
 of longer time of life, having not fo lafting a life, as to ob- 
 ferve the alteration, as the diflolution of gold, or perhaps 
 they have not the right wayes todiflolve it; for certainly it 
 is as all other figures are, diflolvable, and not fixt everlaft-

 Chap. 96. Of the Load-jlove. 
 
 M E thinks ’tis ftrange, that men fhould wonder more at 
 the nature of the Load-ftone in attracting iron, and in 
 the norths attracting o f the needle touched with the Load- 
 ftone, then at the funs attracting of vapor. 
 
 But fome will fay, that it is the nature of fluiditie, of which 
 nature vapor is one, to move with facility, and not the na- 
 ture of folidity, of which nature iron is one, which is heavy 
 and flow j but I fay, if the attracting motion in one body be 
 ftronger then the contracting, and retentive motions in the o- 
 ther body, and thofe figures motions work with, be advantagi- 
 ous; I lee no reafon but a fluid body may attract a folid body; 
 For it is not the fubftance of the body that works, or produ- 
 ceth effeCts, but the agility, fubtility, or ftrength of motion, 
 and advantage of the fhape, fo that the working power is 
 more in motion and figure, then meerly the matter 5 as for 
 example, doth not experience prove that fluid, vitral, will 
 work through folid metal, the reafon is, becaufe the expul- 
 five motions in the vitral and fharp points, are ftronger then 
 the contracting motions, in the metal and blunt edges : but 
 lome wiil ask me, why the Load-ftone attracts oncly iron? 
 fuch a queftion I ask,why beauty fhould forcibly attract the 
 eye? they will anfwer byfympathy; and I have heard, that 
 it was the opinion of learned men, that iympathy had the 
 fame effeCt, betwixt the Load-ftone and iron, but X think it 
 not fo much in fympathy, aslupremacy. 
 
 Befides, it is the nature of contracting motions, of which the 
 Load-ftone is ftrongly inhabited withal, to work on that which 
 is without it, as from it, not within it, or as it were upon it, 
 which no other vifible kinde of motion doth. 
 
 And certainly the Load-ftone is compofed of fharp figures, 
 yet not of fuch lorts as heats or burns, and thofe figures do 
 iffue out as beams do from the fun: and as they draw the 
 iron, they back return, and as the bright beams iffue 
 from the fun, do neither weaken nor leften it, fo the vifible 
 beams that iffue out of the Load-ftone, neither make it Idler 
 or weaker ; yet the beams of the Load-ftone, do as the fun 
 beams, the farther they fpread out, the Idle ftrength they 
 have to draw 5 Befides, if other motions which oppofe , and 
 are ftronger then the natural motions, may weaken the 
 ftrength,as accidental maladies may weaken Animals, or {hrewd 
 and froward weather vegetables, or the natural confifting mo- 
 tions proper to that figure, may turn to expulfive motions, 
 and over-power the natural attracting motions, that ifiiied 
 there-from.

 But as I have laid, it Teems the attractive power of the Load- 
 ftone, is ftronger then fthe irons retentive power, and lharp fi- 
 guresthat ilfue there-from,are more advantagious then the blunt 
 edges in the iron; and as the iharp figures in fire unknit and 
 loolen the contraCtive body of metals, making them fluid, 
 lo the fharp points that ilfue in lines from the Load-ftone 
 faften to iron, drawing it to it ; and as fire worksmpon feve- 
 ral bodies after a different manner of way, according to the 
 nature of the body it works on, producing divers effects ; fo 
 for all I can perceive may the Load-ftone; fox certainly we do 
 not know, nor never can come to that knowledge, as to per- 
 ceive the feveral effects, that are produced from the leaft, or 
 as we account the moft inconfiderable creature made in na- 
 ture; fo that the Load-ftone may work as varioufly upon fe- 
 veral bodies, as fire, and produce as various effects, although 
 nor to our fenfe, nor after the fame manner of waves, that 
 fire doth , and as fire works varioufly upon various bodies, 
 fo there are fires, as feveral forts , and thofe feveral 
 ral forts have feveral effects, yet one and the fame kinde, but 
 asthecaules in nature are hid from us, fo are moft of the 
 effects; but to conclude my difcourfe, we have onely found 
 that effeCt of the Load-ftone, as to draw iron to it ; but the at- 
 tracting motion is in obfcurity, being inviftble to the fenfe of 
 man,fo that his reafon can onely difcourfe,&bring probabilities, 
 to ftrengthen his arguments, having no perfect knowledge in 
 that) nor in any thing elfe, befides that knowledge we have 
 of feveral things, comes as it were by chance, or by experi- 
 ence, for certainly all the reafon man hath, would never have 
 found out that one effeCt of the Load-ftone, as to draw iron, 
 had not experience or chance prefented it to Us, nor the effeCf 
 of the needle, and all the ages before, 1 mean thofe we have 
 Records of, were ignorant of that one effeCt, and perchance 
 other ages may findeoutfome other effects produced there- 
 from, which thefe ages are ignorant of; And as our knowledge 
 comes flow, and in parts, and pieces, fo we know but parts 
 and pieces of every particular thing, neither is the generality: 
 of our fenles capable of one and the fame knowledge ; for 
 what one fenfe knowes, another fenfe is ignorant of, and que- 
 ftionleffe there are fome things in nature that it is impoiuble 
 for our fenfes to be made acquainted therewith; as being too cu- 
 rious for our fenfes, but not toTome other fenfes 5 for certainly 
 nature hath as many different fenfes, as other" works-; indeed 
 all things are wrought by fenfitive motions; which muff needs 
 create a fenfitive knowledge in every thing; and where know- 
 ledge is, reafon is ; for knowledge is reafonyand fenfe is know- 
 ledge ; but fenfe and reafon work in feveral figures; different 
 wayes, and not onely in different figures; but in one &nd the

 Chap. $6. Of the needle. 
 
 J Perceive the norths attraction of the Load-ftone is not af- 
 ter the fame manner of attraction, as the Load-ftone at- 
 tracts iron , for the attractions of the Load-ftone draws iron 
 to it, but the attraction of the north draws the Load-ftone 
 towards it, by the turning it that way, as the Sun will do the 
 the heads of fome forts of flowers ; For if the north attract- 
 ed the Load-ftone, as the Load-ftone iron, the Load-ftone 
 ‘would be in a perpetual motion, travelling to the north pole, 
 unlefle it were hxt, but I do not hear that a Load-ftone doth 
 remove out of the place wherein it is, but it turns, as I may 
 fay, the face towards it ; now the queftion will be whether 
 the Loadftone turns it felf towards the north, or the north 
 turns by compuhion, or by fympathy, the experiment will be 
 by iron, that if a great quantity of iron fhould be laid at one 
 fide of the needle, whether the needle would not vary from 
 the north towards the iron, if it do, it fhews the Load-ftone 
 turns it felf towards the north, or elfe it could not turn from 
 the north, for certainly the north hath a greater operative 
 power to turn the Load-ftone to it , then the Load-ftone could 
 have to turn it felf from it, fo if a quantity of iron can caufe 
 the needle to vary, it fhews that the Load-ftone turns to the 
 north by a felf motion, and not the motions of the north that 
 make it turn to it, but if it varies not towards the iron, then 
 the north forces it, unlelfe the Load-ftone takes more delight 
 to view the norths frowning face, then to imbrace hard iron, 
 or that the feeding appetite is ftronger then the viewing de- 
 light; for it onely turns it felf to the face of the north, but 
 if it turns not it felf, the north forces it to turn, which as I 
 have faid before, is to be found by the experiments of iron ; 
 but if it turns it felf, I beleeve it may receive fome refrefh- 
 mentsfrom thofe raies which ftream from the north, for all 
 things turn with felf-ends 5 for certainly every thing hath felf- 
 love, even hard ftones, although they feem infenfible, fo the 
 Load-ftone may work as various effects uponfeveral fubjeds, 
 as fire, but by reafonwe have not fo much experience of one 
 as the other , the ftrangeneffe creates a wonder, for the old 
 laying is , that ignorance is the mother of admiration , but 
 fire which produceth greater effects by invifible motions, yet 
 we ftand not at fuch amaze as at the Load-ftone, becaufe thefe 
 effects ar e familiar unto us. 
 
 Butperchance the Load-ftone is noiirifhed by iron as many crea- 
 tures are by heat, for though the creatures are nourifhed there 
 with, yet the heat alters not its vertue, nor the body inwhich- 
 the heat inheres^ofes not the property of heating, the fun is not 
 weakned by warming the earth, though the earth is ftronger 
 by the warm ’th of the fun, but warm’th feeds after a fpiri-

 tual manner, not a corporal, and as fomethings are nourifhed 
 by warm’th, fo others by cold, as ice, fnow, and many other 
 things that are above number. 
 
 So the Load-ftone may be refrefhed, although not fed by 
 the cold north, and as fire is fed by fuel, fo is the vertual part 
 of the Load-ftone by iron, or as exercife gets health and 
 ftrength to Animal bodies, fo doth the Load-ftone on iron, 
 and as idleneffe breeds faintneffe, or weakneffe, fo doth the 
 Load-ftone from iron. 
 
 Chap. 98. Of fio/te» ■ : 
 
 F ire hath more power oyer Metals in fome fenfe, then on 
 ftone, and in fome fenfe hath more power over ftone then 
 metals. 
 
 For fire will fooner melt metal, then diftblve ftone, but 
 when the exterior form of ftone is diffolved, it is changed from 
 the nature of being ftone, and be comes dull: and afhes. 
 
 And though metal would likewife change the interior na- 
 ture, if the exterior form were diffolved, yet metal,akHough it 
 be melted, keeps the interior nature, and exterior form, but not 
 the exterior motions ; for metal is metal ftill, although it be 
 melted, onely it becoms fluid, this fheweththat fire doth not 
 onely alter the exterior motion of ftone, but diflolves the ex- 
 terior form, and fo the interior nature, which in metal it doth 
 not, unleffe a more forcible fire be applied thereto then will 
 ferve to melt ; which fhewes, that although the interior mo- 
 tions of ftone be contradioifs, as all folid bodies are, yet the 
 interior, nor exterior natural figure is not circular as metals 
 are, for ftone cannot be made fluid, and as it were liquid as 
 metal will be, but crumbles into duft, and wafts, as wood or 
 the like, and not evaporates away as water , which metal doth; 
 This fheweth that the exterior and interior natural form of 
 ftone is compofed of parts, and not in one piece, as a circle; 
 I do not mean in one piece, as the exterior bulk, but in one 
 piece, in the exterior, and interior nature ; For though you 
 may pound, or file metal to duft, that duft as fmall as Atoms., 
 the like may be done to ftone, wood, and flefh, or any thing 
 that is dividable, yet it will keep the nature of being metal, 
 ftone, wood, flefh, or the like, although the parts be no bigger 
 then an Atom; but if you do diffolve the exterior nature, the 
 interior nature doth diffove alfo, thus the extef tdr i : form

 Chap. 99, Of burning. rr 
 
 A LL that is hot is not of a burning faculty , nor all that is 
 burning is not a&ually hot, and though Burning Moti- 
 ons work ieveral wayes according to the temperament of the 
 matter, and compofure of the figures it meets with, yet the 
 nature of all kinds of burnings is to expulfe by a piercing and 
 Subdividing faculty, provided that the burning Motions, and 
 burning figures are ftrong enough to incounter what oppofeth 
 them 5 but when the oppofed bodies and motions have an ad- 
 vantage, either by ftrength, or otherwayes, it alters the nature 
 and faculty of burning, and many times there is great difpute 
 and long combats amongft the ieveral motions, and different 
 figures,for the preheminency. 
 
 Chap. loo. Of different burning. 
 
 T Hough all that is of a burning nature, or faculty may be 
 called fire, yet all that hath a burning nature, or faculty 
 is not of that fort of fire, which is a bright, fhining, hot, glow- 
 ing fire, as for example, vitrals, brimftone, oyl, or fpirits, or 
 that we call cordials, or hot-waters, or any of the like na- 
 ture. 
 
 Befides all burning figures, or motions, work not after 
 one and the fame manner, though after one and the fame na- 
 ture, being all of a burning quality , or faculty, for fome 
 burn interiorly, others exteriorly, but as X havefaid all bur- 
 ning, is of a fubdividing faculty. 
 
 Chap. 1 01. Fires transformation. 
 
 T He interior, and exterior figures of hot, glowing, burn- 
 ing, bright,fhining fire are ail one, and the motions work- 
 ing apart according to the nature of the figure it works on 
 can change every thing it hath power over, into its own 
 likeneffe, yet the power, and ftrength doth alter fomewhat 
 according to the work, and becoms grofter, and finer, accor- 
 ingto the temperaments, or degrees of that which they work 
 on: as for example, wood that isfeton fire, or afiry coal, 
 is a groffer body of fire, then flaming oyl, or the like, that 
 is fuch a fort of moift fluid matter fet on fire, for fire takes 
 hold, of the thinneft parts, as well as the thickeft; if they be 
 fuch thin bodies which are fubjed to take fire, for when fire 
 is fet to wood, it doth not onely take hold of the folid’fi?' parts, 
 but thofe that are more porous, or fluid, as thofe that rile 
 in fmoak, which become a flaming body, which is a fluid 
 fire,but there is a cold, dul,burning fire, as well as a hot, bright, 
 burning, as aU ftrong vitrals, and this we call hot water , or 
 
 fpirits 
 


## p. 71 (#97) ##############################################

fpirits, whichhave an exterior nature toburn, or diffolve o= 
 ther bodies, and an interior nature to dame, but it hath not 
 an exterior nature to be hot, nor fhining. 
 
 Alfo there is another fort of fire, which onely hath an inte- 
 rior nature to flame, but the exterior is neither actual- 
 ly burning, nor hot, as lulphur, or oyl, though oyl is no- 
 thing, but a liquid fulphur, and fulphur a hardened 
 oyl. 
 
 But this cold dul fire hath not the power of transforming 
 to its own likeneffe, by reafon there is fome difference in 
 the interiors to their exteriors, where the quick, hot , burning, 
 bright, fhining fire, the exterior and interior is all one, with- 
 out any difference. 
 
 Chap. 102. Of fucb forts of beating Motions , as caufe 
 burning . , meltings boiling , Evaporating and 
 ratifying . 
 
 B Urning, melting, boy ling, and evaporating are caufedby 
 feveral motions, or Several degrees or temperaments of 
 matter. / “ 
 
 And though burning, melting, boyling, and evaporating, 
 are caufed by expullive and dilating motions, yet al dilative and 
 expulfive motions, work not after one and the fame manner, 
 but according as the matter is ; As for example, leather doth 
 not burn as wood doth, yet both are diffolved by an expulfive 
 motion. 
 
 Befides, fome figures do diffolve into flame, others moul- 
 der away into duft, and never flame, asftone, and many 
 more examples may be given, but moft commonly all burning 
 motions do pierce, or fnut,or wedge, in jfharp tootht,or poin- 
 ted figures; into thole figures they work upon, and then it dif- 
 folves it by expulfions ; for thole fharp pointed figures, help 
 motion to loofing, and unbinde thofe parts that they finde joy- 
 ned and contracted, that they may more freely feparate thofe 
 parts and diffolve thole figures, which as they diffolve the 
 thinner parts, dilate into vapor, the lighter parts fiie out into 
 fiery points, which are thole we call fparks of fire, but the 
 groffer,and more folid part moulders away into duft and afhes, 
 as being too heavy and folid for the points to fpread forth, they 
 can onely as it were chew it between their fharp teeth 3 for 
 afhes are nothing but chewed wood, yet this manner of chew- 
 ing doth alter the nature from being wood, or any thing that 
 burns after an expulfive manner , but thofe fiery motions 
 that onely melt , or rather thofe figures that are not fubjeCt 
 to burn, but onely to melt, is done by a ftretching motion, 
 for thofe motions do as it were thruft out the contracted 
 parts, and caufe them to extenuate; but when the fiery moti- 
 ons caufe any thing to boy 1, they fir ft ftretch out the parts fb

 far, as caufeththofe parts to be fluid, and as it were liquid, if 
 thole things ' were contra&ed , but if they be liquid and 
 fluid of themfelves, they fave thofe fiery motions that labour, 
 and when this motion drives to afcend with thofe loofe parts, 
 the liquor rileth up in bubbles, or waves, but when thofe fiery 
 motions are over-poured by the weight, they fall back again, 
 thus the weight of the liquor, and the fharp points of the fire 
 drive together, one party drivingto alcend,the other to defcend, 
 io that thole fiery motions, are to pull out, or to bear up, and 
 the watry motion to pull, or pretfe down, but evaporating, is 
 when the extenuating lines are dretcht fo far out, as to break, 
 or the lighter parts are carried away , and difperfed amongft 
 other figures ; but all rarifying heats , are cauled by flow dila- 
 ting motions , and not expulfions, for if fuch forts of dilations 
 as make rarifying heat, were extended beyond the line of the 
 matter they work on, it alters the nature of the figure, and the 
 motions of that nature; but rarifying heat is an extenuating mo- 
 tion, fpreading parts equally, and evenly, but the farther they 
 are fpred, the more hot grows the heat , as neerer to expul- 
 fion, and though all rarifying heat is in the way of burning , yet 
 not in the manner. 
 
 But I mud intreat my reader to take notice, that burning 
 Smotions, make ufe of burning figures, for all Ions of motions 
 work according to the matter and figure they work on, or in, 
 of to. 
 
 Chap. 103. Of. quenching of fire. 
 
 T Here is fuch Antipathy betwixt fire , and fome forts of 
 wets, as fuch wets as are made by fmooth extenuating cir- 
 cles, as they never can agree when they do perfonally meet; 
 and indeed luch forts of wets, have fuch power over hot, bur- 
 ning, bright fhining fire,as they never incounter, but fire is in 
 danger to be quenched out, if there be not a fufficient quantity 
 to break the watry circles , for it is not the coldneffe that 
 quenches fire, but luch forts of wetneffe , for fealding water 
 will quench out fire, and many forts of liquors as wine, or 
 the like, although they be fiameable, yet if they be cad on this 
 bright, hot, burning fire, it will quench it out, by reafonthey 
 are more of the wet nature ; then the oyly, and lulphurous, or 
 the burning or flaming faculty. 
 
 Tis true, that there are many liquors that are fubjed to bum, 
 but there are few wets that have not power to quench, for the 
 fpherical drops do either blunt the fiery points, Or difperfe die 
 the united body, or intangle them in the porous circles. 
 
 Thus water hath the better unleffe the lines break in the 
 combate, but when fire and water treat apart, or by an At- 
 torny, or hath a body betwixt them to Moderate their 
 
 fpleens

 * fpleens they agree better, but in this treaty moft commonly 
 the water becoms weak by ratification, and evaporates into 
 air by too ftrong, or too much extenuating, extending further 
 then the wet compafle. 
 
 Chap. 1 04. Of the quenching of fire, and evaporated Water. 
 
 T Hereafonwhy water quenches fire, is, that the figure 
 being fpherical, and porous, gives diftance and fpace of 
 parts, where the fharp figures of fire, flying about to bite the 
 circular lines afunder, that they may ravel out that figure of 
 water , lofe their ftrength both in their flight and compafle, 
 breaking their forces, by difperfing their parts, and intan- 
 gling their difperfed parts in the hollow places, in the watry 
 figure, like arrows that are lhot into a net, feldom break the 
 net, but intangle themfelves, by reafon there is no firm fubftance 
 to ftrick on, or inj for being foft and fpungy, there is no ftop,nor 
 holdj befides water being wet and wet in the nature is flicking, 
 that when thofe fharp points do at any time break the lines,they 
 joyn again, for being fluid each part moves to each other, 
 and being wet they joyn, and being circular they unite, into the 
 natural figure. 
 
 Thus in a plain combat water moft commonly hath the better 
 of fire,if there be not too much odds on the fires fide forquanti- 
 ty,but when fire doth come by an undermining motion as when 
 fome other figures are betwixt them, then fire gets the better, 
 by the help of thofe undermining motions. 
 
 Chap. 105. Of a brigbt-fhining hot,glomng,fre. 
 
 I T is the nature of bright-fhining, hot-glowing fires, to have 
 both an interior, and an exterior burning, and is of fuch a 
 kinde of fubdividing nature, asitftrives todiffolve all united 
 parts,or bodies, and if it doth not diflolve all bodies it works 
 on, as we ihall fee many things which grow harder with fire, 
 yet is not that the nature would not diflolve fuch a thing, but 
 the power cannot , for thofe bodies that grow harder with 
 fire,oppoies the power of fire, and ftrives by contraction 
 to unite the loofer parts, in a more folid body, to refift with 
 more ftrength. 
 
 Alto fome bodies grow hard by. fhrinkiftg inward, for af- 
 foon as they feel the fire, they draw back, as from an ene- 
 my, having an Antipathy thereunto. 
 
 Thus, it is not the fire that dries or hardens, or maks more 
 folidity, but the oppofite body that will not burn, having a 
 ftrength to oppofe, or a nature not to fubjed to this fire, or the 
 fire hath not a fufficient power to overcome, but this fort 
 of fire hath a general power, though fome bodies will ftrong-

 Cliap. 1 08 . Of the motions of cold^and heat y drouth ^nd Moifure . 
 
 C Oid and heat, are not wrought by different kinds of 
 motions, but after a different manner of workings or 
 movings, for a moift cold, and a moift heat, are but one 
 kinde oi motions, as being motions that extenuate, and en- 
 larges from the center to the circumference 5 for a moift 
 heat, doth thruft, or drive outward, as toward the circum- 
 ference. 
 
 A moift cold doth pull, or draw from the center towards 
 the circumference. As for example, we {ball often fee a 
 gardiner that rolles a green turft walk, to thruft the roll before 
 him, and when he is weary with preding forward, he will 
 turn his arms behinde him, and puli the roll after him. 
 
 Alfoa dry, or congealed cold, and a dry heat, are not 
 feveral kindes of motions, but moves after feveral manners 5 
 for as moift cold, and heat extends, and enlarges from the 
 center, to the circumference, fo a dry heat, or a dry, or con- 
 gealed cold, contracts from the circumference towards the 
 center, the congealed cold in feveral works 5 a dry cold, or 
 a dry heat onely draws into a leffe fpace, or compaffe, yet the 
 fame difference in the manner of the motions, is between a dry 
 heat, and a dry cold, as was between a moift heat, and a moft 
 cold ; for a dry heat drives from the circumference to the cen- 
 ter^ a dry cold draws from the circumference to the center 
 for although ai drought is from the circumference to the center, 
 and all moifture from the center to the circumference, yet the 
 feveral manner of movings are infinite, alfo cold, and heat 
 are not feveral kindes of motions, but different motions, as 
 every man is of man-kinde, but they are different men. 
 
 And if we obferve the effe&s of heat, and cold, we fhall 
 frnde them to work after one and the fame manner^ for ve- 
 ry (harp colds,and great heats, paines equally 5 and fharp colds 
 deftroy with as great & ftrong fury, as burning heats ; neither 
 can I perceive that burning heats have fwifter motions, then 
 fharp colds 5 for water to the quantity fhall freez, affoon as 
 any light matter fhall burn j for water fhall be affoon fro- 
 zen, as ftraw burnt, take quantity for quantity, and Animals 
 fhall be affoon frozen to death if they be touched, or ftruck 
 with very fharp colds, fuch as are neer the poles, as be burnt 
 under die torrid Zone ; as for plants, we oftener fee them kil- 
 led with cold, then heat, and I perceive there is no thaw fo 
 hidden, as a froft ; for when any thing is frozen, it is not 
 fuddenly thawed, which half perfwades me, that cold is the 
 quicker motion ^ but howfoever we perceive they do often 
 difpute for the maftry, when fome time the cold predomi-

 manner of motions, as pleating, folding, furfling, crum- 
 pling, knitting, linking, brading, tieing, binding into a lefTe

 All moift heats, and moift colds, are created, or produ-

 Bricking, or ftretching * but burning heats, are like thole 
 motions that prick a iheet of paper full of holes, or dart it, 
 or cut it, but there are infinite of thefe feveral kinds of mo- 
 tions, which make thefe feveral heats, and colds, working 
 according to the feveral degrees, or temperaments of mat- 
 ter, and the compofers of figures , but 1 onely fet thele few 
 notes to make my difcourfe, as eafy to my readers under-

 the fine ft cloth} where home is like cobweb-lawn, fa 
 fheer, or clear, as the fmalleft obje&s may be feen through, 
 which isfpread about the globe of the earth, as a thin vail 
 Over a face, or body, and from the fun riling, the motions 
 that make light run in lines upon it, and lo is like a gar- 
 ment laid all over with filver-twift, or rather like filver- 
 wier, from the fun riling to high noon, it is as it were, letting, 
 fewing, or imbroidering on ; this ferene air at mid-day it is 
 quite finifhed, and by fun fet it is quite reapt off again. 
 
 And to fhew that the lines oflightareasit were laid upon 
 this ferene air, and not mixt into it, is by the vapor which 
 gathers into dark clouds, which will obfcure the light* as far 
 as they fpread, befides if the light were intermixt the moti- 
 ons and matter could not fo ealily, nor fo quickly withdraw, 
 or intermingle,as we fee they do *, for what is intermixt, is hard 
 to feparate $ but dark clouds are onely as fpots, which by 
 rarification are rubbed out, if they be wet fpots, or drops, they 
 fall out in fhours of rain, but by fuch forts of motions as by 
 ringing, or fqueefing, or griping with a hand, or>the like. 
 Which breaks the fea, or waves of water, which are clouds, 
 into feveral ftreams of drops, fometimds with a greater force, 
 and fometimes with a leffe, according as the motions are 
 ftronger, or weaker. 
 
 The difference betwixt this ferene, and natural air, and the 
 metamorphofed air, is as a natural face, and a mask which is 
 put on, or put off according as the watry circles contra#, 
 or dilate ; the other in probability may be as lafting as the 
 funit feif, not being fubje# to change, but by a natural crea- 
 tion or dilfoiution.

 for when their motions are ftopt, with a more folid matter, 
 then that which they work on to make lights where touch- 
 ing, or beating thereon, they do not break their lines, but 
 the leading innated matter, which makes light, returns back in 
 equal lines, with equal motions, fo as there becomes equal 
 lines of light, onely asfome lines run forward, others run 
 backward , but in ftraight paralel lines, not croffed, nor per- 
 turbed 3 for when thefe motions are croft, or perturbed, it 
 doth as troubled waters do, the one rifing in feveral colours, 
 as the other in waves, fo the colours are the waves, or bil- 
 lows of light.

 tions, no more then the motion of the fun makes all light, or 
 the ablence of the fun makes all darknelfe ; for firft the fun is 
 not the onely light, for we can fet up lights, when that is 
 gone, by fire, whole frames do illuminate that part of air, 
 that is neereft, and could we make a fire as bigg as the fun, and

 our Hemilphear, we may as well fay a fifh cannot fwim, be- 
 caufe fuch a horle doth not gallop , but to my fancy darknelfe 
 works upon the air, as well as light ; for a dark cloud lhall 
 oblcure the light, as well as the light Shall pierce through a 
 dark cloud; thus darknelfe covers many times the face of the 
 light, which fhewes it is not alwayes the with-drawing of 
 light which makes darknefs; fince darknelfe hath as much 
 power over the light, as the light over darknelfe, but obftrubted 
 motions make darknelfe, and hinder thofe equal motions 
 which make light, and thole motions that make miffs, and fogs,

 of darknelfe, and light, are like skeines of filk,whcre the light is

 Chap. i2o. Of amor e probable opinion to me of light making 
 fever al colours. 
 
 r T He lines of light are whole and come fo from the fun 
 * until the light of fuch a figure, and according to the figure, 
 there the lines are broken, and the breaking of light a ccord- 
 ing to the feveral figures, makes feveral colours, fo it is not 
 inherent in the thing, but in the form of the thing, which is 
 the figure that makes leveral colours breaking the feveral 
 lines of light feveral wayes, fo the Diers of feveral colours 
 by their obfervations findes it out by their pra&ife, though 
 they know not the reafon of it, but the true reafon is, that all 
 thofe feveral dies make feveral figures, which feveral figures 
 breake the lines of light feveral wayes, which being bro- 
 ken feveral wayes produce all thole feveral co- 
 lours. 
 
 To fhew you that it is feveral figure that breaks the lines 
 of light that make feveral colours, you may lee it inapigi- 
 ons neck and breft, how many various colours it will change 
 into, with and in the fame place, the lines of light being bro- 
 ken feveral wayes by the pigions feathers, that make feveral fi- 
 gures, as alio you may perceive in Rain-bows, the fun fhining 
 upon a watry cloud, the cloud being between you, and the 
 fun what various colours there are, fo to fpout water out of 
 your mouth, if it be between me and the fun, it makes the fame 
 colours, and all this is nothing elfe, but that the lines of light 
 are broken fo many wayes, by the feveral forms and figures it 
 fhines of, which produceth the multiplicity of all thofe va- 
 rious colours. 
 
 Again, more plainly to make it appear, that there can be 
 no more truth but this in colour, take a rriangular glafie it 
 is all of one colour, and was never lent to the diers , and 
 look in it , and you fhall fee the moft various colours in the 
 world, the colours are not in the glafie, therefore with ra-r 
 tionalman it feffers no difpute at all, that colour is nothing 
 elfe, but the lines of light broken by feveral forms, and fi- 
 gures, that produceth all the various colours that are in the . 
 world. And for excellent difputants, that make riflotle their 
 church of reafon, that cannot erre, and will maintain his* 
 nonfenfe againft reafon, I leave them to their ignorance, and

 S Ome lay colours are made by perturbed or obftructed 
 light, but in my opinion, colours are broken lines of light; 
 for when light is obftruCted as being Hopped it reflects 
 with double light , thofe lines returning back like double 
 firings, and if it were perturbed light, like over-agi- 
 tated air, or troubled and rough waters, the light would be 
 onely thicker, and mudier , having not liberty to move in fo 
 level, even, and ftraight, paralel lines; it is true, thofe per- 
 turbed motions may be the caufe many times of breaking the 
 light, which broken parts contracting into feveral figures, or 
 works, caufeth leveral colours, every particular work, being 
 a feveral colour, and when tjhele feveral figurative works are

 For the leveral works made of the pieces of light, are that 
 which makes feveral colours, and not the pieces of light with- 
 out thofe works, for if thofe pieces of light lay lcattered and 
 not contracted into feveral figurative workes, they could, or 
 would not make colours, but if colours are not made by 
 pieces of light, they are made by contracting the ftraight 
 unbroken lines of light, which contraction turns light into 
 colours, as contractions do water into fnow, ice, haft, froft ; 
 Now it is to be obferved, that it is not onely the contracted 
 motions on the water that make the difference, but being 
 contracted into fuch or fuch a figure ; for whenfoever water is 
 contracted into fuch a manner of figure, it is fnow, if into 
 fuch a figure it is hail, ft in fuch a figure it is ice, into fuch 
 a figure froft, and may do fo conftantly, and eternally, and 
 fo when light is contracted into fuch a figure v it is red, when 
 into fuch a figure, blue, into fuch a figure, yellow,- into fuch a 
 figure green, and when it is contracted partly into the figure 
 of red, and partly into the figure of blue, it makes a figure of 
 purple, and if it be contracted partly into the figure of red, 
 and partly into the figure of blue, and p i rely into die figure 
 of purple, it makes a fourth figure, which is a fourth colour, 
 and fo a fift, and fo infinites, likewile one and »e lame figure 
 which is one perfect colour, may vary with each particular 
 figure, which is each particular colour, and upon what body 
 foever thefe figures are printed, they take colours, and accor- 
 ding as the figures differ, the colours are changed, or alter ; 
 for it is not the body that they arc printed on, ox the reflecti- 
 ons of light, caft upon fuch bodies that make colours, bur 
 fuch figures made by contracted lines of light, which figura- 
 tive works give fuch colours to any thing they can print, or 
 place on, but the reafon why 1 think they are rather broken 
 pieces of light contracted, then contracted ftreight lines, is, be- 
 caufe they are f® lafting, for though lome colours will fade

 is wrought with parts, as I may fay, feveral pieces of thread, 
 is cot io apt to undo or ravel out, a& that which is but of 
 one piece, unleffe the thread were circular, without-ends, but 
 lines of lightrare paralels, and not circles, as for fhadows of 
 colours, in my opinion they are produced after this, ' manner, 
 as I laid, the figure of blue ©r |hc like, which is oner perfeit 
 colour, and the figure of red which is another perfect co- 
 lour makes a third figure, which is a mixt colour,, likewife 
 blue and yellow makes a different figure, which is a different 
 colour from blue and red, and blue and yellow, makes a dif- 
 ferent figure, which is a different colour from blue and green, 
 & fo we may match figures until we be weary ,but whatfoever 
 hath conftantly part of one and the fame figure, in the feveral 
 or fingle compartments of other figures, which are other co- 
 lours, as blue and. green, blue and red, blue and yellow; and 
 the like appears in fhadows, by realon one particular figure, 
 or figurative part is the ground-work, which is, the ground 
 colour , which makes all the colours iq mixes with, partly of 
 its own completion, and according as there are more or lefle, 
 of that figure, the lhadow is fainter or ftronger, . and according 
 as the contractions are more or lefle, the colours are deeper; 
 or paler; for thofe figures that are clofer contracted, and 
 rougher wrought, are the darkeft colours, as neereft to black, 
 and thofe figures that are loofeft,contra£ted,and finer wrought, 
 ars the the lighteft, or paleft colours, as being moft light, 
 when 'the parrs are iooleft, and moft at liberty, and 
 the brighteft, as the moft glorious colours that are made 
 of the pureft, and cleared: light, which is of the fmalleft lines 
 of light, as I may fay, the fineft threaded light, for fome lights 
 are . thicker then others; by realon their lines are grofler. 
 
 Alfo colours which are broken contracted lines of light, 
 may appear darker, or brighter according to the reflection, of 
 other lights, or rather according to the ltraight and unbroken 
 lines of light are that caft upon them, likewife fome light doth 
 alter the colours that are made by other lights, as fome colours 
 appear not by candle-light as by day-light , and thereafon 
 is, that feveral lines of leveral lights, being grofler, ox finer, 
 caufeth the colour to appear duller or brighter, and fome par- 
 ticular lights make fome colours appear more then others, and 
 fome particular lights obfcure fome particular colours more 
 then others, according as they are further, or neerer off the 
 nature of each other; for though the feveral figurative works 
 make the feveral colours, yet it is the lines and pieces of light, 
 that make thofe figures and works.

 A S I (aid before, the folid bodies moving in the foft,& more 
 porous bodies, make many figures therein , fome as prin- 
 ted, dome as painted, others as fculpture, as cut, or carved 
 in wood, or ftone, or caft in metal, or moulded in earth, 
 fome are as if a man, or the like creature fhould print them- 
 felves in fnow, others as if they fhould make themfelves 
 in fnow, as for example ; as if a man fhould ftand , and 
 let the fnow fall thick upon him until he were all covered 
 over, there would be his figure in fnow, or if he fhould 
 lie down in fnow, there would be his print ; fo it is in air, as 
 we move from place to place, new figures are made, and the 
 former figures moulder, or melt out, but according as the 
 air is, fo they laft,or decay, for if the air be congealed with 
 cold, thickned with groffe fogs or miff, the figures laft the 
 longer therein, although in a misfhapen pofture, like ruina-^ 
 ted buildings, or broken ftaraes, or like defeated armies, 
 here an arm, or a piece of an arm , or a hand, and there 
 leggs, here a head, there a mangled body ; but when the air 
 is thin, and ferene, the print diffolves affoon as the figure 
 removes ; and if the air were as folid as fnow, we fhould 
 fee the figures as perfect in the one, as in the other; but the 
 air being very thin, and porous, the fight of the eye runs 
 thorow without ftay, or flop, taking no notice, like water in 
 a fieve, wherein nought can be contained, becaufe there is 
 no hold to keep the water in from running out. 
 
 Chap. 123. Of External figures^ and internal forms, 
 
 I NT fome things there is fuch fympathy betwixt the internal 
 form, and the external figure, as the alterations of the one, 
 change the nature of the other ; as for fire, when the external 
 figure is altered,the internal faculty is gone,here the internal na- 
 ture depends upon the exterior figure; but as for water, the 
 external figure may be changed, as we fee when it is frozen, 
 but the internal nature not changed, for it is as water ftill, 
 though it be not fluid, here the internal depends not upon 
 the external; but thus much the exterior figures of all things 
 depend fo fo much upon the exterior form, or nature, that 
 when the internal is changed, the exterior cannot be altered, 
 from and to, as to change the countenance or face, as I may 
 fay by contra&ion, and dilation, as water, and metals, and 
 many others, but an animal figure may remain, as it was for 
 a time, when the internal is changed, but not Ions, as for ex- 
 ample, Animals, although the internal nature, and faculty be 
 changed, which is to move after fuch a manner, as is proper 
 for Animal, the external figure is not altered : for when A- 
 niffials are dead, the external, which is the outward fhape 
 
 remains

 remains perfect, for a time, yet the internal motions may be 
 in difcrder, as they are in animals that found, or are Tick or 
 faint, or in vegetables that are fading, or drooping ; but wfien 
 the internal motions move orderly again, either of themielves, 
 or by the help of ailiftant. motions, and figures, the Animal 
 is as it was before, and the V cgetablc fiourifheth green again, 
 thus there may be an alteration^ but when there is an abfolute 
 change in the internal, there can be no return, but by anew 
 creation, for all alterations of motions do not do it, but a total 
 change.

 tural Elements . 
 
 T He motions that make the natural figure of earth, are not 
 fo curious, nor the matter they work on fo fine, as thofe 
 which make fire, air, and water ; for the materials being gro(- 
 fer , their work is rougher, like morter that is made of hair, 
 and lime, and the motions moving not (o evenly, or diftinCtly, 
 but rather mixtly, caufeth it to be fad and dark, the folidity, 
 weight, and drought are caufed by the contracting, attracting, 
 and retentive motions , which motions are the chief 
 workers and creators- of this element, which work like ants, 
 drawing all thereto , making it like a round heap, or like 3 
 Load-ftone, that attracts the (olid matter. 
 
 The flimie -or gelly part of the earth is made by fuch 
 kinde of motions as (pin (mall lines lik Silk-worms, in a 
 round hollow ball 5 water is made after that manner, onely 
 thole lines extenuate more into perfect circles. 
 
 Natural and pure air is made by fuch a kinde of motion, 
 as fpiders (pin webs, fmal lines fpread, and enter woven e- 
 venly. 
 
 Natural fire is made by fuch kinde of motions, as the art of 
 whetting, or fharpening , or pointing with a grind-ftone, or 
 Load-ftone or the like, and is made like the ftings of Bees, 
 which pierce, and wound whatfoever they can enter. 
 
 Natural light is made by fuch kinde of motions, as wier- 
 drawing, or drawing a fmall thread from a fpindle. 
 
 Natural darknelfe is made by fuch kinde of motions, as 
 winding up threads upon bottoms, in a heap. 
 
 I fay natural, becaufe they keep their original form, and is 
 the right kinde, and true fhape, as I may (ay ofman-kinde; 
 Fdi: if a creature fhould be partly a beaft, and partly a man, it 
 were not of the right kinde, and true fhape. 
 
 Likewile Elements may be of the right kinde, and yet 
 be different as mankinde, for every particular man is not 
 alike , neither in (hape nor quality, the like may elements 
 differ;

as if oncrid poft,ifit were the moon, why fhould it not be 
 high water, oir full tide Margell , that it is in Scotland at the 
 time, the power of the moon being all one, fo that comes 
 very improbable to me, for many things fall oat at the 
 fame time, and yet the one not caufe of the other, and in Phi- 
 lofophy there is nothing fo ordinary, as to miftake the caufe 
 of things, fince indeed the things for the moft part ate hid 
 from us; fome again will have the Sun the caufe of the ebbing 
 and flowing of the fea , others rationally fay , heat makes 
 motion, and the feas being fait make motion, becaufe it is hor, 
 but how comes it that the frefh waters ebbe and flow ? even 
 (prings well, Whatfoever the caufe be of the feas motion where 
 it moves, ; for in fome places they fay it doth not, 
 but where it moves it is never high water in one place, but 
 it is low water in another place, and the fea moves alwayes 
 circularly, for as it is the nature of water to be made in fi- 
 gures of circular lines, fo it is the nature to flow circularly, 
 which in my opinion is the reafon of the ebbing and flowing 
 tides, that moves circularly , that is, part of a circular, where 
 the convex flows ftill forward, the flowing motion extends 
 more and more, cauling it to fwell out, and the concave ends 
 to extend longer and dofer, in fo much as at laft the con- 
 cave ends are joyned into a convex, for it doth not extend in 
 aperfeCt round circle, as I lhall deicribe in my following dif- 
 courfe, but after an oval, or rather a pear figure, but when 
 the flowing convex is extended beyond the ftrength, it ftraight 
 breaks, being moft weak, by reafon it is moft extended out, fo 
 that when the tides have no more ftrength to flow for want of 
 water to extend, and the convex over-powred by extenuation, 
 it breaks afunder, and fo falls back, whereby the convex parts 
 are now become the concave, and where it was concave, is 
 now become convex, which caufeth it to flow the other way, 
 and ebb where it did flow, for where it lies concave it ebbs, 
 and where it is eonex is flows, and thus ; it ebbs and flows 
 
 perpetually, whbre it hath free paftage, but the farther it flows, 
 die weaker it becoms, by reafon the ftrength is abated, like 
 a horfe that hath run faft and far, at laft is fo weak and 
 breathlefle as he falls down, fo when the convex can extend 
 no farther, it bheaks in two, but as the convex extends, the 
 concave ends draw clofer together, whereby fuch time as they 
 cbme to joyn, the convex is fo bowingly fttetched, as' it be- 
 comes brittle, a$ I may fay or weak, which caufeth it to 
 break; but it is to beobfervedthat the tides have a double mo- 
 tion, for as the convex flows forward, the concave ends draw 
 backward at one an'd the fame time, for the extenuation of 
 convex one way , caufeth the extenuation of the concave 
 ends the'other way ; but" by reafon the two ends draws clofe 
 towards a point, the ebbing waters feem narrow 
 and little, but the ebbing tides are but an effect of the

 flowingtides, not a caufe in it felf, for the interior nature of 
 water is to how where it can get liberty, and freedom of 
 paffage,and where it doth not how it is obftru&ed by fome 
 obfcure caufe, but I defire my reader not to miftake me, as to 
 conceive the motions of the tides, and the interior nature of 
 water ail one, being fomething alike j but the motions of the 
 tides, and the motions of the interior nature of water are as 
 different as the local motions of Animals, and their interior 
 nature, and I beleeve if the frefh waters had the fame liberty 
 as the fea waters, to how which way they would without op- 
 pofition,or obftru&ions of hils, dales, banks and walls, and had 
 the like quantity to move withal, I beleeve they would as 
 naturally how as the fea, and ebbe when their ftrength fails, 
 and I beleeve if there were a fufficient quantity of water in the 
 fea, and no obftru&ions, as Iflands, creeks, and the like to hin- 
 der the pafTage, and that the earth were like a billiard ball, it 
 would how perpetually round, as the Globe turns upon the 
 Pole, if the Pole turns not round with the Globe. 
 
 Chap. 128 . ‘Describing the tides. 
 
 T He bowing water gathers up together like fuperhous hu- 
 mors, and lwells out the convex, as corrupted matter doth 
 the skin, and never leaves extending till it breaks, but it begins 
 by degrees in a demy-circle, and as it hows it grows larger, 
 and longer extending its compaffe. 
 
 And as the convex extends, the concave ends mull of necefli- 
 ty draw clofer together. 
 
 Which makes the ebbing waters like a tail to the convex, 
 which as the body, which makes the ebbing waters to be nar- 
 row, and by the reafon the bulkol the water hows in the 
 convex,it caufeth the concave ends to be fmall, which makes 
 it fhallovv, and the more the concave ends extend , the fmaller 
 they are, like thread drawn from a full diftaff of haxj forfo 
 the concave ends draws, or rather extends from the convex 
 body 5 But as I faid before the more the convex extends, the 
 cloler the concave ends draw together, and when the convex 
 is extended to the uttermoft they joyn. 
 
 And affoon as ever they are joyned and mixt together into 
 one point , as it were, it fwels into a body. 
 
 For the former convex being broke,the waters fal back to that, 
 part which was the concave, but now is become the convex, 
 and that part which was the convex, is now become the con- 
 
 cave 5 , , . 
 
 Yet the convex muft be full before the concave ends extend, 
 like as a glaffe that muft be filled above the brims before itcan 
 run over.

 it hath more ftrength to extend farther, and the tides to be 
 higher becaufe the convex is thicker, and fuller, for the greater 
 body of water, the farther it howes 5 for it is for want of 
 ftrength which makes an ebb, or want of paftage which makes 
 a flop, and when the tides are lower, there are fome invifible

 T He reafon the tide flows againft the ftream a of River, Is, 
 that the quantity of fea water fofteth through the ftream, 
 and the defcent of the river forceththe ftream to paffe through 
 the motion, or rather by the motion of the tide, for the natural 
 motions of all waters being to flow, and the force of the def- 
 cent added therto, gives it a double, if not a treble ftrength, fo 
 that when the force of the tide, and the force of the ftream 
 meets, and incounters, they make paftes, as Duellers that fight 
 .hand to hand; but if one Water runs quite through another, it is 
 moft probable that the tide runs through the ftream, by reafon 
 it is armed ftrongly with fait. Which may caufe it to be ftream-

circle, or circle upon circle, makes filch quick rebound, 
 which rebounds in contracting and crofling each other, make 
 a confuted found , which we call tempeftuous and itormy, 
 and it is to be obferved, that a temped in 'the air, and a 
 ltorm in the water, and thunder, is much after one and the 
 fame kinde of noifej But as thunder is caufed by the expulfion 
 of the mod extended circular lines, fo winde b the expulfion

 they be not very violent, caufe rain ; for the expulfed motion 
 being no dronger then to preffeupon the unbroken and ex- 
 tended circles, either of vapor, or air , drives it into the wa- 
 try compaffe, but when the weather is cloudy, it is not alto- 
 gether lb hard pred upon, as to drive it into perfect water 
 circles, but to the next degree, as a thick vapor. 
 
 And when the weather is uncondant, as we fay, that is 
 fometimes groffe and thick, and then it will be drait clear, 
 and bright, is as the preffer doth abate, or increafe 5 but 
 unforced raines (as I may call them) which is without a vio- 
 lent condraint, is when thofe circles are drawn into a wetry 
 compafTe in a natural order, and by the natural waight, be- 
 ing thicker then natural air, that is original air, and not tranf- 
 migrated water, it falls down on the earth. 
 
 Likewife the pouring {bowers make a found, by the force 
 of the falling drops, driking as they fall, found 5 but by rea- 
 fon the water is divided, by the falling motions into leffe bo- 
 dies, as it were, which makes not (o drong a found, having leffe 
 compaffe as the tides, or air having fewer circles in a body, 
 as in drops, which makes it of a leffe bulk, and the leffe the 
 f>ody is, the weaker, and the fmaller is the found. 
 
 But when the watry lines are drawn into a triangular fi- 
 gure of fnow, it falls filently without found, by reafon the 
 watry line is drawn out of the extended circle. Belides, that 
 figure is the lighted figure, by reafon of the inequality, for a 
 fquarehath four equal parts, which makes a jud number, fo 
 an equal ballance which gives it a deddy weight, and a circle 
 is equally round, without parts, which gives a deddy weight. 
 
 But a triangular figure is in three parts , which is no jud 
 number, nor equal ballance, nor jfeddy weight, which make 
 it of leffe force, for being a wavering figure, it cannot preffe 
 hard, nor drike drongly, nor fall heavy, but flies lightly a^

 when they are extended from water to vapor, from vapor 
 to air, from temperate air, to hot air, from hot air to fire ; 
 for if thole circles extended beyond the compalfe, and ftrength 
 of the line, they break, which is the caufe of thunder, and 
 lightning , for alfoon as the lartheft extention of the circle is 
 broken , thole extended parts do with an extraordinary fwift 
 motion run, or rather fhut forth into bright flaming fiafhes, 
 as fpinning lines of light, but when thofe lines extend with a 
 ftrong ftrength, they break into lmal parts, which caufeth 
 thunder to follow lightnings 5 for thole btc-aking parts fome- 
 times expulfe dilorderly, beating and ftriking upon thofe 
 circle lines that are unbrokc, which circles being of a hollow 
 figure, caufe a found in the higher region, whereto they are 
 alcended, for their extention caufeth them to be light, their 
 lightnefle to afeend ; But all hollow figures being concave 
 within, and convex without, do prefent to the ear, if they be 
 ftrong, as concave, and convex glalfes doth obje&s, when pre- 
 i'ented to the eye * thus hollow figures caufe a hollow found 
 if they be ftruck, for the concave draws thole motions in which 
 rebounds from fide to fide, and the rebounds continue t e 
 found by the Echos repeated, for found lafts longer in hollow 
 figures, then in any other, and though I will not fay that 
 oriely hollow figures make founds, yet I fay that no found can 
 enter but through hollow figures, as the ear is a hollow fi- 
 gure, and ail hollow figures/ and the ear is not onely hol- 
 low, but circular, but founds are made in the ear, or rather 
 enters, as light and colours in the eyes, for dilcord is pertur- 
 bed motion, or rather clofe Antipathetical motions, and har- 
 mony are fympathetical, and regular motions, but the more of 
 thefe extenuating circles break, the more lightning there is,and 
 the ftronger they brea, the more thunder rhere is, and the har- 
 der they ftrike upon the unbroken circles the lowder is the 
 found. 
 
 But if the circle lines break onely afunder, and extend , or 
 fhur forth into ftraight lines without more parts, there is one- 
 ly lightning without thunder, but if thole lines break into 
 more parts, there is thunder alfo, and when there falls rain 
 at thofe times of thunder, it is when the gentler motions of 
 fome of thofe expulfed parts , do not ftrike hard upon lome 
 of thofe unbroken circles, but preftfe upon them, which caul- 
 eth them to draw, and gather into a lefle circle, and a grofifer 
 line, untill they return into the watry compalfe, where grow- 
 ing too heavy for the hight, falls down toward the center oi the 
 earth, as all heavie bodies, if not thick bodies under to bear 
 them up, or ftronger motions then their weight to hold them 
 
 up.

 whcn< it rains, thofe unbroken circles return into ks nature

 Chap. 13 & Of the alterations of motions, 
 
 O Ke and the fame degree of innate matter may change, 
 and rechange the natural pofture motion in one and 
 the lame figure, but a general alteration of thofe motions 
 proper to that figure, dilfolves the natural form of any one 
 particular figure, for g figure moving by feveral motions* 
 proper to its kinde, muft joyntly confent either by a fympa- 
 thy, or inforcement to make a diffolution, as well as a crea- 
 tion, but all motions works or alter according as the matter 
 is, or figure they work to, or forced by ftronger motions to 
 alter their natural courfe * likewife feveral and contrary mo- 
 tions may work by turns in one and the fame figure, by one 
 and the lame degree of innated matter.

 A LL extenuating motions make not fludityor wet, but 
 fuch kind of extenuating on fuch tempered, or on fuch 
 degrees of dull part of matter, for tome extenuating motions 
 make light, others make heat, and infinite the like, fo allex- 
 pulfive motions do not burn, nor all couira&ed motions ; do 
 not work alike, nor all attractive, nor- all retentive, nor expul- 
 five 5 for there are infinite wayes or kindes of them, which 
 works infinite varieties, for there are infinite feveral forts of 
 heats, coldes, droughts, moiftures (and infinite kindes of lights 
 and darknelfe as well as of colours, fo infinite wayes of con- 
 tractions, and attractions, and infinite wayes of expullions, 
 and fo there are fuch varieties in one and the fame kinde, as 
 it is impollible for me to defcribe, as for one man to draw 
 the feveral pictures of mankinde from all eternity* but if I 
 could draw but one picture , it will be enough to {hew my 
 art and skill, although but a plain draught, but I finde the

 motions move hot after one and the fame manner ; but I 
 hear mean by local motion, that which naturally can move 
 from place to place, by their interior nature, and exterior 
 fhape, but if the word is not right to the lenfe, pray par- 
 don it, and take the fenfe and leave the word, and Chriften 
 it a newjbutthefe kindes of local figures are water,arie, and fire, 
 which move after an Animal manner,although they have not the 
 fhape of thofe we cal Animals, yet they feem Animals by their 
 felf motion,as moving from place to place, unlefle they be ftopt 
 by ftronger motions, or other figures that are more powerful: 
 the like of other Animals, as for example, if one man, or more 
 being ftronger bindes another man which hath not ftrcngth, 
 nor power to oppofe, or hinder them, he cannot move accor- 
 ding to the property of his nature and fhape. 
 
 So likewife, if cold contra&ions be more powerful then the 
 extenuating circles, it bindes up the the water with icie fetters, 
 wherby it cannot move according to the nature, nor circular 
 fhape-, fo if any man fhould go to a place, and a high wall 
 fhould ftand betwixt him and that place, he cannot pafte un- 
 leffe there were a paftage, or that he can clamber, which 
 muft be by art, becaule there is no footing, and to jump o- 
 ver it he cannot, for it is fo high that the weight of his body 
 will pull him down, before the ftrength or agilneffe of his 
 limbs {hall raife him over, and he cannot flee over by reafon 
 his fhape is not fitted thereto, having no wings, fo water being 
 ftopt, and the paftage hindered, by a thick bank of earth, can- 
 not move according to its property j for it is proper for wa- 
 ter to move defcendingly, at leaft ftraight forth 5 but when 
 itakends, it is forced by other more powerful motions, fo 
 likewife it is proper for air to move atter a level, ftreaming, 
 orfpreading manner. 
 
 For fire to afeend, after a piercing, fhooting, and perpendi- 
 cular manner, for thefe elements do as other Animals do, for 
 man,beafts, birds,fiihes, their local motions are different ac- 
 cording to their fhapes, for it is the property of a four legged 
 creature to gallop, trot, pace, run, leap, but they cannot nee, 
 becaufe their fhape is not fitted thereto, having not wings, 
 nor a bird cannot gallop, trot, nor pace, having not fourleggs 
 to make changes therewith, it is true, a two legged creature 
 may leap, jump, hop, and run. 
 
 Likewife thole fifhes can neither run nor flee, that have not 
 
 wings nor legs ; but thofe that have mixt fhapes, have mixt lo- 
 cal motions, as there be fleeing fifhes, and fwimming birds, and 
 running fifhes, and fwimming beafts, indeed moft creatures can 
 fwim,for moft fhapes are fitted thereto in one kinde or another, 
 but mans fhape is fuch as it can imitate moft various motions, 
 thoughit is the fhape that makes al creatures to move different 
 ly, yet it is not altogether the fhape that makes them move lo- 
 cally, but there muft be fuch an interior nature proper to fuch

 {hapesj as Vegetables and Minerals, their property is not td 
 move locally, that is, to have a felf exterior motion. 
 
 Itfeems their interior nature, and exterior jfhape is not pro- 
 per thereto, or perchance it is only»their exterior fhape,and not 
 their interior nature that makes them unfit to move lo, for we 
 finde their interior nature to be more aCtive then many of the 
 exterior fhapes of Animals* But to return to thole elements 
 I treat of, as fir ft water, the interior nature caufes it to be liquid 
 and wet, the exterior fhape to be fluid, both agreeing by a 
 fympathetical conjunction give a local motion to delcend, 
 and bear all before.it, or with it, that is loofe, and unfixt, fo 
 fire, the interior nature cauleth it tq be hot and dry, the exte- 
 rior figure to be lhafp to burn, both agreeing by a fympathe- 
 tical con junCting, giving it a local motion to pierce and divide 
 it, all it can enter into, if not over-powred; fo air, the inte- 
 rior nature cpifeth it to be foft, and pliant, and the exterior 
 figure to be thin and learching, both agreeing by a fympathe- 
 tical conjunction, gives it a local motion to enter through all 
 porous bodies in a level line, and to fill up all vacant places 
 in other figures, unlefte it be thruft out, and kept out by lome- 
 thingmore powerful It is the natural property for fire to be 
 hot and dry, to be fharp and burning, to move alcending. 
 
 And for water to be liquid, fluid, and wet, and to defcend 
 in a defcending line. 
 
 And air to be foft, and yeelding, to be thin and fearching, to 
 move in a level line, unlefle they be forc’d otherwaies, for fire 
 may be iuppreft downward, and water forc’d upwards and air 
 difperft, and fire is not onely lubjeCt to be fuppreft^but quench- 
 ed out for water, if there be a fufficient quantity to the fire 
 on which it is caft, will over power it : for the innated motions 
 which caufe water to be wet, deftroy the motions that caufe 
 fire to be fharp and burning, and the figure deing de- 
 ftroyed, that is difuniting thofe parts, and thofe motions,' 
 that keep and maintain thofe parts in that figure, the proper- 
 ty. is extinguifhed too, as we fee many Animal figures , 
 do to one another, and birds, and fifh, and men, deftroy 
 beaft, birds, and fifh, according as they have ftrength, power 
 and advantage, for indeed the diffolution of one figure is the 
 caufe of the creation of another, fometimes the materials of 
 one figure, make many figures, and fometimes the materials 
 of many figures make but one figure 5 and an Animal figure 
 hath many feveral manners of moving locally, and, the ele- 
 ments as other Animals do move fomtimes flower, and fome- 
 times fallen , . .

 I T is to be obferved by thofe figures that are wrought by the 
 way of lines, are (oft, fmooth, and finning , whether they 
 be paralel lines, cupe lines, triangular lines, or circular 
 lines, but the fmaller, and ftraighter the lines are, the 
 Imoother, and brighter is their work, but there are feveral forts 
 offoftnefle, and ieveral forts of fmoothneffe which are made 
 by feveral kindes of motions. 
 
 Then it is to be obferved, that all works of contractions, and 
 retentions are ftronger , and more lafting, then thofe 
 figures that are more light, and porous, or extenu- 
 ating. 
 
 Thirdly,it is to be obferved, that the innated matter, which 
 works upon the light, and thin part of dull matter, is more 
 agil, and nimbler then that which works upon the thick and 
 iolid matter, unleffe the ftrength of the motions be not above, 
 or at leaft equal to the folidity of the matter. 
 
 Alfo it is to be obferved, they can make lolid figures of light 
 thine matter, by their clofe, and curious joynings injeCtures, 
 and mixtures, and porous, and light figures of folid matter, by 
 their dividings, and fpreadings, but though the innated matter 
 can contra# and dilate, the thick, or thin, light, or heavie fluid 
 or foft, yet it cannot alter the nature,or degrees of the dull part 
 of matter, neither can the innated matter make it felf wea- 
 ker, or ftronger then by nature it is, lcr the entity of onely 
 matter cannot be changed, but though the nature cannot be 
 altered of dull part of matter, yet it may be cut, and carved, 
 and joyned and difperfed into feveral figures, fo the inndted 
 matter,although the nature cannot be altered as to make each 
 degree weaker, or ftronger, yet they may move fwifter , or 
 flower, according as the dull part of matter is they work on 
 Or according as the curiofity of the figure requires; and as I 
 have faid before, there be infinite degrees of the dull part of 
 matter; as folid, and fluid, thinner, and thicker, lighter and 
 heavier , harder, and fofter, and infinite degrees of innated 
 matter* as ftronger, and weaker, fwifter and flower,and though 
 I have faid that the innated matter is the thinneft part of onely 
 matter, yet I do not mean the thin incipit matter, as I may 
 call it for diftinaion fake; for there is no incipit in infinite, 
 and eternal matter, though there be dull in moving matter, but 
 die innated matter is the infinite extra# of the entity of infinite 
 matter, it is the quinteffence of nature.

 to create, difTolve, and difpofe of figures, as they pleafe to 
 move, fihare as it were the infinite matter, in their work- 
 ing and dividing , and feveral motions, which is proper to 
 the creation, of fuch kinde of figures, aftiftirig each other 
 in their works of creation ; but not in the figures diffolu- 
 tion ; for thofe motions which are proper to create one 
 kinde of figure, are not proper to create another, for every fi- 
 gure hath different motions, in the creation either more or 
 idle, which is the reafon few, or none are juft alike, but either 
 in fhape, or minde will differ, but when two figures are made 
 with the fame motions, among the fenfitive innated matter, 
 then their figures are juft alike, as we fhall fee twin?, and if 
 the rational matters motion be juft alike in feveral figures; 
 their dilpofitions and underftandings are juft alike, and if they 
 differ in the ir motions but a little, they refemble much either 
 the minde, or the body; fometimes both, but the more they 
 differ, the leffe they refemble, but almoft all creatures are di- 
 ftinguiihable, which fhewes fuch variety of motions, as there 
 needs no more repetition to move after one, and the fame mam 
 ner ; for there are not onely different motions in different, 
 and feveral figures, but in one and the fame figure, for the 
 fame figure doth not look when it is old, as when it was young, 
 nor when itisfick, as when it is in health; nor when it is 
 cold, as when it is hot, nay the figure will alter and change, 
 every minuit either by the altered motion of the f enfitive,or ra- 
 tional ; but moft commonly they alter their motions together, 
 as in a joynt concent, for a troubled minde will make the body 
 appear heavy and fad, for joy and grief will make different 
 countenances in the figure, and fo every paftion in the minde, 
 is moft commonly matched with a countenance agreeable 
 thereto, and moft commonly other exterinal a&ions, yet al- 
 though the motions may differ, the innated matter may be of 
 one and the fame degree, for I do not fay every degree of in- 
 nated matter moves alwayes in one kinde of motion; for 
 though every degree of innated matter, is of a particular 
 ftrength, yet not of a particular motion.

 on different degrees of dull part of matter, which makes dif- 
 ferent figures by different motions, and as this world is of a 
 fpherical figure, fo other worlds may be of other figures ; as for 
 Animals, although all Animals are not of one fhape ; for a

 kinds, as well as in their leveral forts , for beafts kind dif- 
 fer from birds kinde, fo may worlds differ for all we know, 
 and if we fhould gueffe by the feveral changse, and variety in 
 nature, it is very probable it is fo^&who knows,or indeed might 
 not very eafily beleeve it fo to be, that worlds may be match’d 
 by a fympathetical conjunction to produce other worlds, as o- 
 ther creatures do, for we finde the planets by a fympathetical 
 conjunction to produce other creatures, as the fun and the earth. 
 And it is to be obferved, that as feveral motions create fi- 
 gures, fo feveral motions work by their created figures, and 
 thofc motions that creates figure by a fympathetical conjun- 
 ction, create after their own likeneffe, either in the nature 
 or fhape, or both, but thofe figures that create figures with- 
 out conjunction of figures, after their invention, or imitation as 
 I may fay, cannot make fuch figures as conjunct ially of figures 
 man calls artificial figures, as birds make nefts, or beafts make 
 dens, and men houfes,but to reckon all artificial figures, is paft 
 my skill, and beyond my life , who knows fmee we finde new 
 and unheard ftars, but that they are the birth of other worlds.

 drowning it by dropfies. And though I may fimilize it , to any 
 figure,yet I onely imploy it a to man-kinde;that is, to havefa per- 
 fed and upright fhape,a clear ftrength, found parts, plump and 
 far, clean from grofs humors and obftrudions, to keep it 
 healthful with wholfome food, to help nature with cordials, 
 or phyfick, death being the deftruCtion. 
 
 Chap. 143. Of natural felf-tyrannie . 
 
 M Otion doth not onely divide matter infinite, but difturb 
 matter infinite ; for felf-motion ftriving and ftrugling 
 with felf-motion, puts it felf to pain 5 and of all kinde of mo- 
 tions the animal motions difturb moft, being moft bufie, as 
 making wars and divifions,not onely animal figures, againft ani- 
 mal figures, but each figure in it felt, by difeontents and diilikej 
 which difeontent makes more pain,then eafe,orpleafure,or tran- 
 quillity, by reafon of irregularity; but motion is an infinite and 
 eternal tyrant, on infinite figures;for as motion makes figures, fo 
 motion diffolves figures, which makes infinite, and eternal 
 matter, eternal reftlefs ; for the extrad of infinite matter, 
 which is an innated matter, which innate matter is motion, and 
 makes the dull part of matter fo too, by working thereon ; thus 
 the onely and infinite matter is a tyrant to its felf, or rather, I 
 may fay, infinite, is a tyrant to motion, and motion to figure.

 and eternity to all. For though infinite, eternal matter, motion, 
 and figure, are individable, yet they are all as feparated, in 
 afpiring for motion, although it is but an effed of matter, yet 
 ftrives tor abfolute power over matter and figures, and infinite- 
 neis ftrives for the abfolutenefs and power over matter, mo- 
 tion and figure j and eternity ftrives for abfolute power over 
 all ; thus the effects ftrive to have power over the prime cau- 
 fes, which is the onely matter ; for if there were no matter, 
 there could be no figure, nor motion, nor infinite, nor ever- 
 lafting, the like do the minor effeds over the minor caufcs, 
 for effeds are caufes of effeds. 
 
 Chap. 144. The two ground motions among ft the 
 rational innate matter. 
 
 T He rational innate matter, moves as it were two-fold, for 
 they have different motions in the figures, from the figu- 
 rings, Ike as the fenfitive matter, which moves the dull part 
 of matter, internally and externally, according to the nature 
 of each figure j as for example, the creating of a figure is one 
 way, and the leverall adions of the created is another way , 
 the like doth the rational innate matter, it ftrft runs into figures, 
 and then moves figuratively : Again, fome figures they are 
 ftronger then others, will force the weaker figure to move af- 
 ter their manner. 
 
 Chap. 145. The two chief parts belonging to man j is the head , 
 and the hearty wherein refides the rational fpiritS. 
 
 T He head, and the heart, are the two refiding parts, for 
 the rational innate matter to move in, making paifions in 
 the heart, and realons in the head ; and whenfoever thofe 
 parts be difaffeded, the underftanding and pailions are difor- 
 dred, and many times fo, as never to be redified ; but fome 
 times this diforder comes by the mif-working of the fenfitive 
 inrated matter, and fometimes by the wrong fteps andfalfe whichnio?es 
 meafures of the rational innated matter. But though the an- ; n figures like 
 nimal knowledg or reafon be difordered, yet not extinguifhed, dancing, 
 unlefs the annimal fenfe be abfolutely altered, which is to dye } 
 for though they move not regular, yet they move after an a- 
 nimal manner : As for example, a man although he goeth not 
 upright, according to his natural fhape, but creeps upon his 
 hands and knees, or that he is forced to role from place to 
 place, having neither armes nor legs, yet he moves in an ani- 
 mal manner, and partly to what his natural fhape is, forthefe 
 force motion, or want of fome of the outward parts alters him 
 not from being an animal, nor it from being a man, unlefs all 
 the fenfitive motions, which naturally belong to their figure, 
 be altered, and then he turns from that kinde of creature.

Chap. 146. whether the yafiions are made in the 
 head or heart,} 
 
 C^Ome are ofopinion,the palfions are made in the head ^others 
 c^that they are made in the heart 3 for my part I am of the lat- 
 ter opinion 5 that is, that all paffions are made in the heart 3 
 asLove, Hate, Fear, Anger, Grief, Jealoufie, Envy, Malice, 
 arid the like • and alio the Will, and opinions, which area 
 kinde of palfions 3 and that imaginations, conceptions, fancies, 
 underftahding, judgment, memory, and remembrance, is 
 made in the brain 3 and that which we call thought , or ani- 
 mal knowledg is made both in the brain and heart 3 for if either 
 of thele two parts be wounded, that knowledg dies, as both 
 the fenlitive knowledg, and rational, both being that which 
 we call thought, the one belongs to the body, the other to the 
 minde 3 for touch is a weak thought, and thought a ftrong 
 touch 3 and my realon is why I think that the pariions are crea- 
 ted in the heart, and not in the head, is, hr It, paffion and 
 judgment feldom agree. 
 
 ""Secondly, when we have the paiTion of fear or anger, or 
 the like 3 all the motions that work tothofe palfions, are felt 
 in the heart 3 for if wedooblerve, we fhall finde all palfions 
 arife from the heart, and all the parts near thereto will be di- 
 flurbed3 when in the brain we finde no violent motions at all, 
 perchance the fenfitive part may be difturbed, as to make the 
 head-ache, as with a general diftemper. 
 
 Thirdly, there are oft times paffions felt as it were in the 
 heart, without any knowledg, or thought of it in the head 3 as 
 when we fhall be fad, and angry, and fearful, and know no 
 realon why. Be tides, objects many times palfe by, or as it 
 were, fteal through the fenl'es, and likewife creep through the 
 brains, and raife a paffiion in the heart, without any notice ta- 
 king thereof, or knowledg how it came therein. 
 
 Laftly,that although there is a. great lympathy betwixt the 
 palfions, and imaginations, yet they are not after one and the 
 fame manner of motions, which fheweth they are created in 
 feveral figures,the one in the triangular heart, & the other in the 
 fpherical brain, and the different fhapes of the head and heart, 
 may be one caufe, that makes the difference betwixt palfions 
 and imaginations, as well as the different motions. 
 
 But to prove palfions are made in the heart, and not in the 
 head, is, that when the brain is diftempered and mad, as we 
 fay, yet the palfions may be free and regular 3 and Love, and 
 Hate, which are the two chief palfions, may be conftant to the 
 objeds they were placed on 3 thus the minde or foul, which is 
 the rational innate matter, lies as much in the heart, as the 
 head.

 Chap. 147. Of different pa ft ions in one 
 and the fame part. 
 
 A S for palfion, we (hall love and hate at one and the lame 
 time, but not one and the lame thing, at one and the 
 fame time, for that is impoflible. 
 
 But different palfions are made according to the fubjects or 
 objects they move by, or to ; yet the rational innated matter 
 which creates palfions, may move partly lympathetically, and 
 partly antipathetically, at one and the lame time. As for ex- 
 ample, a man may be in love with a woman, for her beauty, 
 or wit, or behaviour, and yet have an averfion to her bad qua- 
 lities 3 but a man cannot love the perfon of a woman, and hate 
 it, at one and the fame time, buc to the creating of thofe pal- 
 fions, that fympathies, as love, and hope, and joy, and the like 3 
 The rational innate matter, doth as it were fpread, and delate 
 its felf 3 but lor thofe palfions that antipathies, it contra&s it 
 felf more together 3 as in hate, fears, jealoufies, doubts, envy, 
 lpight, and the like 3 and when two or three paflions ariie at 
 one time 5 as a palfion of grief for my friend that is killed, and 
 a palfionate hate to his murtherer, or the like 3 then the ratio- 
 nal innated matter, divides its felf, partly moving after one 
 manner, and partly moving after a quite contrary manner, and 
 fo may divide into as many parts, and after as many feveral 
 manners, as their place or quantity will give way to 3 but when 
 we love what was hated, or hate what was loved, then the in- 
 nate matter changes their motions, towards liich a fubjebt, or 
 objedl, without a divifion 3 but when they move diforderly, 
 the palfions are like a tempeft at Sea 3 palfions beat againft 
 palfions in a confufed manner, difcempering the whole body, 
 cauling the lenles to miftake, with the violence thereof 3 like- 
 wife in the brain there may be oppofite motions, amongft one 
 and the fame degree of innated matter, either rational or fenli- 
 tive, either by an alteration ol motion in one and the 1 fame part 
 of matter, or by divilions moving in parts 3 but when the ratio- 
 nail innate matter moves in a regular divifion, and the mea- 
 fures of time, and the notes of motions- skilfully let, and right- 
 ly kept, that is curioully or neatly, and carefully ordered 5 then 
 there is a harmony, which harmony is a quiet minde, gentle 
 imaginations, a clear underftanding, a folid judgment, eleva- 
 ted fancies, and ready memory3 but when this rational innated 
 matter moves diforderly, there arifes extravagant fancies, falfe 
 realons, mifunder Handings, and the like.

 innated matter, is as much in the heart, as in the head, and

 fympathie with each other, whether by recourfe, or otherwife 5 
 as pailions will raife imaginations, corrupt judgment, difor- 
 der reafon, and blindfold underftanding : And imaginations 
 will raife palfions, as fear,' love, hate, doubts, hopes, and the 
 like ; which fhews that the rational innate matter, in the head, 
 and heart, hath fuch affinity as the Ienfitive innated matter 
 hath in the ftomach and head ^ as the pain in the head will make 
 the ftomach fick, and a ficknefs in the ftomach will make the

 more of the rational innated matter, in his little brain, then 
 the beaft that hath more braine, for the rational innated mat- 
 ter, moves in the brain, not on the brain, for that is wrought 
 and moved by the Ienfitive innate matter, being made of the 
 dull part of matter j for when the brain is defedive, it is cau- 
 fed by the fenfitive innated matter, not the rational innated

diftind, for the paflages being ftraight, many objeds entree- 
 at once, make a coniufton, at leaft a diforder, for if mcly, 
 then one objed be prefented at one time, to any particui/e 
 lenle, they are received but by piece-meals, as in the fmai, 
 parts ; and many times the divided parts are fo mixt together, 
 as no piece is perfectly feen or heard, or fmelt, or tafted, of 
 touched ; belides, the paffages being ftraight , the fenfttive 
 innate matter cannot work fo regular, having not liberty, for 
 it is not with the lenfitive innate matter as with, the rational 
 innate matter, by reafon the fenfttive innate matter works 
 upon grofs materials, as upon the dull part of matter, which 
 makes that it cannot move fo nimbly, nor divide into parts fo 
 iuddenly, efpecially in a ftraight paftage, as the rational innate 
 matter can, which moves onely in number and meafure, with- 
 out any dull mixture, for the rational innate matter, can 
 figure out the whole world, and millions of feveral figures 
 therein, fooner and (wider then the fenfttive innate matter, 
 can print one figure upon any of the l'enfes j and not onely thofe 
 figures that the fenfttive innate matter prefents, or hath pre- 
 iented, but makes thofe figures that were never prefented, as 
 thofe we call phantafms ; and as I (aid the rational innate mat- 
 ter hath more room to move in, as in the head, and heart, then 
 the fenfttive innate matter, hath in the ear, eye, noftrils, mouth, 
 or pores of the fiefh, fo there may be a greater quantity, or 
 proportion of that rational moving matter together, in a body, 
 or bulk, as I may fay, then of the fenfttive innate matter, in 
 the forefaid paftages, and according as the quantity of the ra- 
 tional matter is, there is the more knowledge, and clearer 
 underftanding ; the quicker wit , and the livelier memory, 
 the frefhcr remembrance, and the more multiplicity of 
 thoughts ; for it is not onely the largenefs, and extent of the 
 place wherein the rational matter moves in, that makes the 
 more knowledg and underftanding, and the like, but the quan- 
 tity of the rational matter ; for a great head may have but a 
 little wit, or dim underftanding, and a little head a quick wit, 
 and clear underftanding 5 if the little head be full of this ratio- 
 nal innate matter, and"the great head be empty thereof j but if 
 the room (or. place) be large, and filled with this fort of in- 
 nate matter, according to the bignefs, that creature will be 
 very knowing, underftanding, and ingenious $ for imagin that 
 all the heads of mankinde were put into the compais of one 
 head, and afufficient quantity ol that rational matter therein, 
 that creature whatfoever it were, would have not onely the 
 knowledg of every particular brain joyned together, but that 
 knowledg and underftanding wouldf increafe as ufe-money, 
 for that bulk or bank would multiply, being put together.

 Any wonder what Thoughts arc, and how fuch mil- 
 t ^-“-lions can be within fo little a compafTe as the 
 jrain. 
 
 I anfwer, that a little quantity of the rational innate mat- 
 ter, may make millions of figures, which figures are thoughts. 
 
 As for example , from eight notes, milions of tunes^are 
 made, and from twenty four letters millions of feveral Lan- 
 guages may be made. 
 
 Likewife one lump of clay may be molded, and formed in- 
 to millions of feveral figures ; and like Pictures many figures 
 may be drawn in one piece, and every figure in a feveral po- 
 flure; Likewile a little pi&ure will repreient fo great an 
 Army, as would take up many acres of land, were it in a 
 pitched field. 
 
 Again, a Globe no bigger then a Head, will prefent the 
 whole world. 
 
 Again, fay fome, how is it polTible there fhould be fo many 
 feveral thoughts in the head at one time, and how from one 
 thought fhould there arife fo many of a fudden, and at fome 
 times fo extravagant as to have no coherence therein, at other 
 times very methodicall, and fympathetical? 
 
 To the firft I anfwer, how many feveral poflures may a 
 man put his body into at one time, nay, I may fay one part 
 of the body ? for how many feveral poflures may the face 
 draw it felt into atone time? 
 
 Secondly, I anfwer, that many feveral wheels will move 
 with one motion, nay with one kinde of motion feveral wayes, 
 and many wheels with feveral motions leveral wayes, and all 
 within one, and the fame compafTe, and from one prime 
 fpring. Again, fome may wonder how it is poffible figurative 
 thoughts can inlarge and contrail the demenfion, and exten- 
 fion ; I anfwer, how is it with Profpedive glaffes, convex, and 
 concave glaffes ; likewife a fereen, or a fan, or the like, which 
 can fold in many folds, into one fold, then can draw them 
 out into a plain flraight piece again, and (o fhut up into a

 thoughts, for difpleafing thoughts of grief, and all fad re- 
 memurances caule the minde to be dull, and melancholly, 
 or froward, and difcontented ; and pleafing thoughts caufe 
 - the minde to be chearful, pleafant, and delightful. Befides, 
 the minde is like chewing of the cud, for what the fenles 
 bring in , and are fed with outward objects ; thofe fwallow- 
 ed oujedts, the thoughts of the minde chews over again ; thtfs 
 the minde is alwayes feeding ; befides, the lenles have no 
 longer pleafure, or pain then the objects remain ; but the minde 
 is as much grieved, or delighted when the objeft is removed, 
 as when they are prelent ; As for example, a man is as much 
 grieved when he hears his friend is dead, or kill’d, as if he fa w 
 him die, or flaine ; for the dead fried lives in the minde, 
 not the minde in the dead friend, and if a man have a fine 
 houfe, or great riches, or an excellent rare race of horfes,or 
 the like, whereupon the minde takes as great delight in think- 1 
 ing of his fine houfe, as if it dwelt in the houfe, and as great 
 delight in thinking of his riches, or what he could do with 
 the ufe of his riches ; for the minde doth not fo much dwell 
 in the houfe, as the houle in the minde, nor the minde doth 
 not take fo much delight in the ufe of the riches, as the ufe to' 
 be in the minde, and the remembrance of the curious horfes 
 is as much in the minde, as when thofe horfes were in the 
 eye ; for when the lenfe is filled, the minde can but think, and 
 the minde may as well think when the objedts are gone, as 
 when they are prefent, and the minde may take as much 
 delight, in thinking what the fenfes have enjoyed, as what 
 they 'are to injoy, or delire to enjoy ; for thoughts are the frui- 
 tion of the minde, as objects the fruition of the fenfes; for 
 the minde takes as much delight (if not morej in thinking of 
 an abfolute power, as when the commands of an abfolute 
 power is obeyed, for obedience dwells no more in the minde 
 when it is adted, then it did before it was adfed, or by the 
 imagination that it is adted ; thus the minde receives no more 
 by adtion, then it doth by contemplation, onely when the 
 pleafure of the fenfes are joyned with delightful thoughts, may 
 be faidtobe more happy, though I beleeve the plealiire of 
 fenfes draws the delight from the thoughts; for the more at 
 reft the body is, the more bufie the minde is imployed, and 
 as torments of the minde are beyond the torments of the body, 
 or at leaft the difpleafure of the fenfes; fo the delight of the; 
 minde is beyond the eafeor reft of the body, or the pleafure 
 of tfie fenfes.

 lenfitive motions are tired, with the working on the dull 
 parts of matter, which tirednelfe is flacking the motions, or 
 changing their motions, as when they work lafily, then the 
 figure grows droufy, and the fenfes dull, being weary of pen- 
 ceiling, copying out objeds upon the optick nerve. Likewife 
 with printing letters, and fetting notes on the drum of the 
 ear, or in drawing platlorms ot feveral tails, touches, and 
 fents on the tongue and pores of the flefti, or ftriking, or 
 playing on the nerves, and on the dia mater and pia mater, of 
 the brain, but many times the figure grows drowfie, and the 
 fenfes dull, when the fenfitive motions are idle for want of 
 work , that is, having no variety of objects prefented to themj 
 that is, of fuch kinde of works } for the innate matter never 
 ceafeth to move, although the motions are not alwayes agil, 
 and quick, nor atter one and the fame manner, but when they 
 alter the motions, as I may fay more proper then to flacken 
 them, they do as it were caft anchor, pulling down their fail, 
 going as it were under hatches, and the figure that is like a fhip, 
 where the motions of the breath are like waves of water, that 
 heave it up, and then fink down, but faile not, nor fleer not 
 to any Coaft 5 and the fenfitive innate matter which is in 
 this adion,like Mariners when they work under the hatches 
 drawing and winding up the flimy humours in the body, like 
 ropes by attractive motions, flaying and fetling the loofe 
 parts, by retentive motions ; a placing and putting difordered 
 parts into their proper places by difgeftive motions, and all 
 the motions bufiely imployed ; lome mending the figure,

 running up, and returning from the deck, which are the pores

 Animal fhip, and the fenfitive innate matter, as the Saylors, 
 thofe works on the dull part of matter, the other direds 
 when occafion ferves, that is, when the body is in adion • for 
 though the rational innate matter never labours on the dull 
 part of matter, yet they counfel and dired the animal fhip, 
 when it is built, and fet afloat, that is, when the body is come 
 to the full growth, and orders it in bluftrous ftorms, and 
 great dangers, but thefe the rational innated matter, when 
 this animal fhip is caft to anchor, which is to deep, moves 
 onely in a rocking, or rowling motion, as it were from fide to 
 fide of the cabbin, which is the brain, making no perfed figure

 nor gives diredion, this is fleeping without dreaming ; but 
 dreaming is when they move in figures, making fuch figures 
 as thefe objeds, which have prelented to them by the lenfi- 
 tive motions, which are onely pidures, or copies of the O- 
 riginal objeds, which we call remembrance, tor remembrance 
 is nothing but a waking dream, and a dream is nothing but 
 a deeping remembrance, but it the fentitive innated matter 
 moves in the fame manner , on the fame place , as printing 
 and drawiug tiich figures or objeds in the optick nerve, 9 , or 
 letting fuch notes or letters on the drum of the ear, or draw- 
 ing fuch platforms on the dura mater, or pia mater of their 
 brain, or the tongue, fiefh, or skin of their own accord, with- 
 out the pretence of the outward objeds ; then we tee here 
 taftc, fmell, touch, as lfrong as if we were awake, if their 
 motions be as ftrong and indudrious; but many times w r e 
 have in deep thofe objeds but in part, and not in whole, the rea- 
 l'on is,that either the fenfitive innated matter is flow, or elfe they 
 are not fo perted Artifts to work without a fampler, working 
 by mifplacing, and miftaking, or elfe works by halves, ac- 
 cording to their skil, or as appetite moves them, make a hog- 
 pog, or gallimophry of many feveral pieces or draughts, into 
 one figure or pidure, which make extravagant dreams ; by 
 reaton they work not in a methodical manner, and the ratio- 
 nal innated matter, moving in the tame manner makes a 
 mixt refemblance, but the fenfitive innate having not the 
 outward objeds in deep to work by, teldom works per- 
 fed, or plain, and working imperfedly they move diforder- 
 ly, and tor the mod part that which makes us fo often pertur- 
 bed in our deeps, is, by moving crotfe , and irregular, which 
 crotfe , Irregularity infnarles feveral motions , fo as there is 
 no didindion, which is the reaion that our dreams are fo often 
 obfeure, and dark, as we can make nothing of them; and when 
 the rational innate matter moves erode, and tumultuoudy, 
 our dreams are mod commonly fearful , and when the fenli- 
 tivc innated matter works to diforderly, our dreams are pain- 
 full, and when the ientitive innated matter works perfedly, 
 and the rational innate matter moves juftly , we have as much 
 knowledge, and underdanding of what we dream of, and 
 as much iatisfadion from our fenfes, as if we were awake, and 
 the real abjeds prefented to us. 
 
 Chap. 154.- Dreamings of living, and dead figures. 
 
 T Hofe friends in acquaintance that that have been dead, « 
 longtime, and appear in our deep, we never quedion 
 the truth of their life, though we may quedion them how

 ter, as the waking motion doth on the out fide, and when we 
 hear them as it were difcourfe words, right on the infide 
 of the drum of the ear, or pia mater, by the feniitive mo- 
 tion, as on the outfide when we are awake ; for all the fenfitive 
 works inwards aileep, as outward awake ; for if we fmell 
 ients plea ling, or diipleafing, the fenfitive ipir its draw lines, 
 and let notes on the infide of the dura mater and pia mater 
 of the brain ; and lo for tafte and touch, they draw plate- 
 forms in the infide of the skin, cither of the skin of the tongue, 
 or any other outward parts of the body, as they do on the 
 outfide of the skin awake 5 Thus the fenfes prefent as perfedt 
 prints to the rational ok times in deep, as awake, oneiy they 
 print, on the infide a lleep, and on the outlide awake, and what 
 rational creature would not belecve their lenles ; lor fhould 
 a man lee another man die, and fee him buried, and after- 
 wards fhould fee that man alive again, and hear him Ipeak, 
 and touch him, fhall feel the fub ltance of defh, would not 
 he think he lived ? Thomas the Apoftle queftions the rela- 
 tions of our Saviours refurrection Irom the grave, but never 
 queftioncd his fenfes, when he faw, and touched him ; fo in 
 our dreames, when the leniitive innate matter prints fuch fi- 
 gures on the optick nerve, as of fuch a perlon which is dead, 
 the rational matter ftraight paterns out the lenfitive print 5 
 and when the fenfitive print, and the rational figure is jufta- 
 like, the other motion of the rational matter cannot quefti- 
 on the truth of that figure, or figures being there, though they 
 may queftion how they come alive, again treating with it, as 
 if awake, the fame is lr the fenfitive innated prints, any thing 
 as dead, which is living, and the rational pattern it, the reft 
 of the rational motions make no queftion of the truth of thole 
 fleeping motions, untill waking motions otherwaycs inform 
 them ; for rational motion in every particular figure, knows 
 lktle of the fenfitive, but what the fenfes fhews them, in the 
 feveral motions, yet the rational generally knows what they 
 prefent unto them, which every particular lenfe doth not, 
 each motion is unknown, and are ftrangers to each other in 
 one and the fame figure ; for the ear knows not what the 
 eye feeth, nor the eyes know not what the nofe Imelleth, nor 
 the nofe knows not what the tongue tails, nor the tongue knows 
 not what the body feels, but the rational innat matter in a fi- 
 gure, knows all the fenfitive motions in the lame figure , as 
 long as the figure is perfect, and moves in an Animal way, and 
 tha-t-the rational motion moves regular; for when the motions 
 are irregular, they can take no pcrfed copies, nor notice how 
 the fenfitive move, that is, the reafon that in perturbed 
 palfions , which are oneiy :rregular motions, the fen- 
 les become' as it were ufelelfe to them, but moll commonly 
 the diforder of one brings the diforder of the other, I will

gular, the rational is regular, but not at all times, for fome 
 times the one is regular, the other is not, but the rational which 
 takes copies of the fenfitives is oftener difordered-by the fenfi- 
 tives, then the fenfitives by the rational, for when there is grief 
 in the minde, many times the body is in good health, but it is 
 feldom known when the body is lick, but the minde is trou- 
 bled. 
 
 Chap. 155. Of Local Dr ernes. 
 
 *T tie reafon that many times we dream of walking woods 
 •!■ orhoufes, and the like, is through this following reafon; 
 
 The rational innate matter, as I often faid before, turns moli 
 commonly into fuch figures, as the fenfitive innate matter 
 prints, or hath printed upon the lenles, now if a tree or houfe, 
 or the like, be printed on the infide of the pi a mater , or the like 
 fenfitive part, when we are afleep, the rational innate matter 
 ftraight figures them, thefe figures move after a local manner, 
 although they have not an animal, or local fhape ; the reafori 
 is,that the rational innated matter being purer in it felf, without 
 the mixture of dull matter, moves onely in their own matter, 
 and the figure moves in the matter ; whereas the fenfitive in- 
 nated matter working upon the dull part of matter, moves in 
 that dull matter, and not the dull matter in the fenfitive inna- 
 ted matter, that is the lenfitive innate matter moves in the dull 
 part of matter,and the dull part of matter is moved by the lenfi- 
 tive innate matter ; thus the fenfitive figure is moved, but not 
 moving, but the rational innated matters figures give their 
 own motions ; likewife if we have feen a battle, or heard of a 
 battle, and afterwards we dream of the fame, or of the like 
 battlejthen the rational innated matter puts its felf into Animal 
 figures, and moves after a local manner, each figure placing 
 it felf after that manner or way as was related, or printed by 
 the fenfes, or after away of its own invention, and when the 
 figures encounter each other, as they muft do to fight a battle 
 in the brain ; and then fome feeme to be falling, and others 
 dead, and fome mangled ; thofe figures are as falling and bro- 
 ken, and ceafe to move after the local manner; and When 
 one party feems to move as in a confufion, then the motions are 
 irregular, and juft as the fenfes prefent, lo doth the rational 
 innated matter a<ft in the brain when we deep, and fometimeS 
 when we are awake, as in imagination.

 is a houf dr a tree,or any the like grofs material figure, thele be- 
 ing placed beforethe palfage of the eyes, thofe fenfitive fpirits, in 
 the eye taking notice thereof,with the help of that brings the ob- 
 jects therein, ftrait prints or paints thofe objeds upon the optick 
 nerve, or upon the outfide of the brain, as the dU mater , or pia 
 mater , upon- which the rational lpirits view as on pidures, then 
 copie them out, not by working oh the dull part of matter, as 
 the fenfitives innated matter doth , but turn themfelves by 
 number and meafure, into figures like thofe printed or painted 
 figures } tlie difference is, that the rational matter is like fculp- 
 tures, the others as pictures upon flats ; thefe rational figures 
 we call knowledg, or underftanding, and as long as thefe ra- 
 tional figures laft, though the objed is abfent, and the prints 
 rub out, by other objeds, or by diftance of place, or the like, 
 we call memory ; but when thofe rational figures are diffol- 
 ved, and afterwards repeated be wrought without a prefer- 
 ment of the fenfes, we call it remembrance, arid the reafori the 
 memory is not fo ftrong, as the prefent fenfe, nor the remem- 
 brance 10 perfed as the memory is ; that with the prefent ob- 
 jed there are two figures as the rational fculpture, and the 
 fenfitive point, when the memory is but one, as the lculpture, 
 which remains as with the rational, but the fenfitive print is rub- 
 bed or worn out, and the reafon why remembrance is not fo 
 perfed, as the memory, is , becaufe remembrance is but a 
 copy of a copy, from the original print, for remembrance is 
 but a pattern taken from the "Memory, and the memory but a 
 pattern taken from the objeds.

 HP He reafon why figurative fenfes are quicker then the figura-

 of matter then in cutting out fculpt figures, not for the ftrength 
 of adions, as for the feveral laborious adions therein, fetching 
 their material a far way, and for many feveral places, which 
 requires time and place, when printing is but a prefs laid upon

pores of the skin* and the like, and thefe outward objects are 
 presented, to that part of innate matter which I call rational 
 lpirits, but that part of innate matter I call fenfitive fpirits 5 
 as for example, thus, there is a houfe, or a tree, or any the 
 like grofs material figure , which is fubjed to the fenfe of ani- 
 mal figures, thefe (landing at the doors of the eyes,which as foori 
 as the fenfitive lpirits perceive, or other feniitive lpirits that 
 come in through thefe doors, flrait print or draw the fame 
 figure upon the optick nerve, which optick nerve is made of 
 dull matter, by the fenfitive fpirits from whence the rational 
 fpirits viewing from thence that pi&ure, flrait run themfelves 
 by number and meafure into the likenefs of that pidure, which 
 are thofe we call knowledg or underflanding, and as long as 
 thofe figures lafl among the rational fpirits, though the obje&s 
 are abfent that we call memory, for when thefe prints are rub- 
 bed off by the fenfitive fpirits, and others placed thereon, or 
 vaded by diflance of place, or obfcured by fhutting the lids, 
 yet the figure thereof may remain amongfl the rational fpirits, 
 which is, as 1 faid before, memory, and the repetitions of 
 figures 5 ti$t is, when one and the lame figure was diffolved 
 and created again amongfl the rational, it is remembrance 5 
 but memory is notfo flrong as the prefent fenfe, nor the re- 
 membrance fo perfect, as the memory and the reafon is, that 
 what the fenfitive fpirits wrought on the optick nerve, is like a 
 printed or painted figure, and that which the rational fpirits 
 make is like a carved flatue, like painting, or fculpture, fo 
 that in memory the fculpture remains, and in remembrance 
 is created, although the printing , or painting is worn out, or 
 rubbed out, fo that the prefent fenfes have two figures, one up- 
 on the optick nerve, the other amongfl the rational fpirits, 
 wherein memory remains but one, and the reafon why re- 
 membrance is not fo perfect as memory is, becaufe it is but the 
 copy of a copy from the original, for remembrance is but 
 a pattern taken from the memory, and the memory but a pat- 
 tern from the object.

 and thefe refiedions caufe double lines, which make the fcn- 
 fitive figures on the optick nerve appear plain to the rational 
 figure, but it they rebound, and refiedions be difordcrly return- 
 ed by dilordered motions, they make a confufion, both in the 
 fenlc, and rational knowledg, asfortaft, it ftrikes from the 
 nerves of the tongue, upon the brain, befides the hollow cave 
 of the mouth, and according as the rebounds are made, and 
 the ftrokes are ftruck, the tafte is ftronger or weaker, but if 
 the brain be huff’d with cold, then the concaves being ftuft and 
 fo flopp’d where the rebounds lhould return, caufe the tafte 
 to be weak, infomuch as not to be fenfibly felt ; and for touch, 
 the pores of the skin and fielh are hollow ^wherein rebounds are 
 made, ftriking from fide to fide of each pores ^ and we finde 
 by experience that thofe parts which are not hollow, have not 
 fo ftrong a fenfe as thofe that are hollow : Again, if the nerv es 
 from whence the ftrongeft ftrokes are ftruck be C flack, the 
 fenfe is weak. 
 
 As for feent which is brought through the noftrils of the nofe, 
 like water through fpouts, w hich dilates its lelf through the 
 brain circling the pi a mater , f welling, flowing and ebbing, like 
 to the fea about the earth, which when it flows it is ftrong, but 
 when it ebbs it is weak. 
 
 But by reafon feent is made by ftreaming motions, and nor 
 ftriking and retorting motions. As the other four fenfes are, 
 it retaines not fo long in the memory as the others do, although 
 it may laft longer in the brain or head, being more lafting, 
 moft commonly for the prefent then the reft are, for a ftinke 
 will remain in the brain a great while, and fo will ftrong per- 
 fumes. 
 
 Chap. 160. Of Sight. 
 
 r T“ He general opinion is, that all objects come through the 
 •» optick nerve, and print the figures received on the brain, 
 and that there are, nor can be no figures in the brain, but what 
 the opticks bring in, and have pahed through the eye ^ it is 
 true, by experience we finde, that without an eye, we cannot 
 fee an outward object, as they are without us, yet we fee thofe 
 pbjedts, as they are without us in our fleep when our eyes be 
 {hut; thus the fenfe of feeing is not loft, although the eyes 
 were out, and the optick nerves flopped up. But fome will 
 fay, thofe objects in dreams have paft through in part, or in 
 whole, therefore the queftion will be, where an animal can 
 have an infight, if it were born blinde ; but if it be fo, as the 
 opinion is, that no figure, or infight can be, but what comes,

 or hath paffed through the eye, andoptick nerve, muft want 
 that fenlib'le knowledge ; for according to that opinion, the 
 ear can do the underftanding no fervice as toward that l'enfe, 
 by reafon found can make no figure to fight, neither will 
 tafte, nor font ; but fome may lay, touch may difoover fome- 
 whatofthat fonfe to the underftanding, but I think not; for 
 in my opinion, touch is as fonflelfo to infight as found ; for we 
 cannot comprehend more of touch then of found, for depth 
 and breadth are no more to infight, then high notes, and low 
 notes, nor foft nor hard, no more to infight then fwift, and 
 flow,fharp, or fiat, nor pleafure, nor pain, no more then 
 harmony, and difeord ; but my opinion is, that figures are as 
 inherent to the minde, as thoughts 5 And who can have an 
 unfigurative thought, for the minde cannot have thoughts, but 
 upon fome matter, and there is no matter but muft have fome 
 figure, for who can think of nothing ; but the minde is like 
 infinite nature, having no dimenfion, or extendon, no center, 
 nor circumference,no breadth, no depth,and as the innat matter 
 creates figures, lo the minde, which is the matter creates 
 thoughts, which thoughts, are the figures of the minde; for 
 when we hear of a deity, we lay in words it is an incorporeal 
 thing ; but we cannot conceive it lo in thought, we fay we do, 
 but we cannot prove we do; Tis true, the minde may be in 
 a maze, and fo have no fixt thought of any particular thing ; yet 
 that amaze hath a figurative ground,although not fubferibed; as 
 for example, my eyes may fee the fea, or air, yet not the 
 compaffe, and lo the earth, or heavens ; lo likewile my eye 
 may fee a long pole, yet not the two ends, thefe are but 
 the parts of thele figures, but I fee not the circumference to 
 the uttermoft extention, lo the mind in amaze, or the amaze 
 of thinking cuts not out a whole and diftindt figurative 
 thought, but doth as it were fpread upon a flat, without a 
 circumference, and though there are not fuch figures in the 
 brain, as it brought through the opticks, yet liich figures as 
 the minde creates ; for the minde is innate matter, and in- 
 nat matter is felf-motion, and lelf-motion, is alwayes mo- 
 ving, and working, which working is figuring; thus the fen- 
 fitives innated matter prints figures iu t f he brain , and the ra- 
 tional innated matter creates figures in the brain after its own 
 invention, which are imagination and conception, wherein are 
 made imaginary worlds, without the materials of outward 
 objects: and perchance thefe motions may create fuch a figure 
 as this world, and fuch feveral figures, as the leveral creatures 
 therein, although not fo lolid and lafting,becaufe thofe motions 
 want thofe grofle materials, of which they fhould create it 
 withal ; but the fenfitive innated matter in this caufe, prints 
 thele figures upon the brain by patterning the rational figures 
 created in the brain, like as when it doth the outward objects.

 and when the fenfitive innate matter works on the infide,asin 
 deep, then it gives an infight, which are dreams according to 
 their copied prints, and thefe motions may make lines of light, 
 triangular lines, for colours let notes of tunes, draw plat-forms 
 of tafte, and fent, make prints of touch, not onely the ratio- 
 nal innated matter, by imagination 3 but the fenfitive inna- 
 ted matter gives a feniible touch on the brain of all the out- 
 ward fenfes , by which touch, I mean fenfible knowledge; thus 
 the interior motions may move the brain with the variety of e- 
 very fenfe , without the exterior paffages, or objeds, 
 and although it may not make thofe very objeds and fub- 
 jeds 3 yet luch as are proper for each fenfe, and of the fame 
 nature as I laid before, draw lines of lights gathering motions 
 make clouds, triangular motions make colours, infnarled 
 motions make darkneffe without the outward objed, and 
 all other/nctions that make feveral figures, or printed figures. 
 
 Like wife refiedions without the help of the eye and fo re- 
 bounds, and retorts 3 for found, and let notes print words, 
 and plain tunes without the ear 3 fo likewife for tafte, lent, 
 and touch 3 but when the brain is filled withoutward objeds, 
 the natural motion feldom works after their own invention, 
 having not room as it were, or elfe it is as it were over- 
 powredwith work, having more objeds brought in, then 
 they can either conveniently place or fort, or diftinguifh 3 but 
 weak minds, which are flow moving matter, think life an in- 
 fenfible thing, and the head, or brain empty of figures,when 
 it is not filled with outward objeds, like as a barrel is not 
 filled with liquor, thinks it empty, becaufe the thin air with 
 which it is filled, is not fubjed to their groffe fenfes, fo not to 
 their weak capacities. 
 
 Thus it is not the outward objeds that make the fenfe, but 
 the innate matter , which is felf motion, which is the fenfe and 
 knowledge, and the different motions therein, and therefrom, 
 make the differences thereof, and though different fenfe 
 and knowledge, may be in different, and feveral figures, and 
 fuch kind of fenfe & knowledge proper for fuch kind of forts of 
 figures ;yet the figure adds nothing to the fenfe, and knowledge, 
 although the innated matter may give a figure fuch a kind of 
 fenfe and knowledge and when that figure dies, that kinde of 
 fenfe and knowledge may alter,which was proper to that kinde 
 of figure;yet if it were the figure that gave the fenfe, and know- 
 ledg, and not the innated motions, there would be no alterati- 
 on when the figure is made, or any extraordinary paffion, 
 whereby experience we finde the fenfe, and knowledge do 
 alter all, though the figure be perfect, and in health.

 Chap. 162. Of Blindnefle. 
 
 B lindnelfe proceeds from many caufes , as when the . 
 
 criftalline part of the eye is not clear; for if it be dimming, 
 or failing, orfpotted and foul, the objeds leem muddy, and 
 mifty, and as the water of the crift aline is coloured, fo the 
 objects appear ; for as Diamonds, fome are of a black wa- 
 ter, others of a yellow water, fome of a green water, or blue, 
 others of a white water , fo is the criftalline part of feve- 
 ral eyes, and according as it is clear, or coloured, fo all ob- 
 jects appear. 
 
 A lecond defed may be in the ball of the eye ; for accord- 
 ing to the compalfe of the concave, or convex thereof, the ob- 
 jeds are prefented neerer , or at a further diftance, or longer 
 or fhorter, or broader , or narrower. 
 
 A third defed may be in the eye hole ; for according to the 
 largeneffe, or littlenelfe thereof, objeds are prefented, either 
 in whole, or in part, bigger, or lelfer, more, or fewer objeds 
 enter at once ; for if the eye-lid hole fhould be too large, the 
 fpecies would difpe’rfe too much, difuniting parts and figures, 
 and iftoofmall, the fpecies cannot paffe in ranck and file, as 
 I may fay; for though the fmallerthe circle is, the cloferit 
 contrads the fpecies, and draws the objeds into a ftraighter 
 line; yet if they fhould paffe in a crowd, they will flop the 
 mouth of the paffage, like water in a glaffe when turned

 A fourth defed may be in the optick nerve, if it be full of 
 {lime, and the like, it darknens the light, ftopping the palfage 
 of the light, or if it be fhrunk, or dried up, likewile if the head 
 be full of grofle vapours, it obfcures the fight, as a thick mift 
 doth the lun * for this foul foggy, and groffe vapors hinder 
 the fpecies from entring, and the fenlitive innated matter that 
 fhduld print thefe objeds, on the optick nerve, and if they 
 are not quite ftopt, yet it hinders the regularity, making that 
 innated matter to work by piece-meales," or elle ftaies not fo 
 long, as to take a perfed furvay. 
 
 The lift and fixth defed may be, if the eyes move too quick, 
 or too flow, which makes the fight impeded, or dull * for too 
 quick motions of the eye dazles the fight, and clips and cuts the 
 exterior objeds into fo many parts, as no one part can be 
 perfectly known, or feen * and too flow motion blunts the fight 
 like a fharp point that is ft ruck upon a ftone, or the like * be- 
 fides,when it is fixt too long upon one objed, other objeds 
 palfe by before it removes , or wearies it fo much as one 
 cannot take notice of it * But when the eyes are too quick, it is 
 byreafonthe nerve firings that tie and f'aften the ball of the 
 eye to the head, are too flack, which makes the eye ball fo loofe 
 as the leaft motion moves it, or elfe thefe nervous firings are 
 too {mall which makes them fo weak, as every little motion 
 moves, fo as they are alwayes in motion as it were * for if the 
 "nerves, and fincw-ftrings be too fmall for the weight of the eye 
 ball, it mky alwayes have a trembling motion, like a sthe afpen, 
 or like weights that cannot poile fteddy,as long as there is a dif- 
 proportion* and when the eyes are too flow the realon is when 
 the linews, or nerve-firings, are fo fhort tied, or fhrunk up, fo 
 that it holds the eye ball too hard, or too ftraight, giving it not 
 liberty to ftir, and turn from fide to fide, or to role a- 
 bout. 
 
 A feventh defed may be when the eyes look afquint, as it 
 may do two leveral wayes * the one is when the ball 
 of the eye is tied too fhort, by the nervous firing towards the 
 note, by which the balls of either eye, are drawn fo much 
 inward to each other, as to look at each other * but that they 
 are fome wayes hindered by the nofe, this makes the lines or 
 points* that fhoot from either eye, to meet acrofle, which 
 makes all exterior objects to look double* but if the eye 
 firing ties the balls of the eyes too fhort towards the temples 
 it draws the points from the center, and the eyes out of the 
 natural bias which caufeth a fide look, as feeing two feveral 
 wayes at once, but neither way perfedly, by reafon that the 
 lines that iffue from the eyes, lie not level, neither can 
 thofe lines meet upon an objed, in a triangular, which joyns

 A Fter the fame manner is the lenfe received at the ear, 
 onely the difference is, that inftead of drawing, printing 
 the outward objects, received through the eye, printed on the 
 optick nerve,fo the lenfitive innated matter, fets, or pricks down 
 notes, and draws lines on the drum of the ear, as muficians do 
 upon paper, or the like ; and the fenfitive innated matter in 
 making tnem run, and make flops according as the vocal found 
 is let, and it is louder, or lower, according as they work 
 weaker or ftronger, but for the verbal, it is writ, or printed on 
 the drum ofltheear in letters, for words, and the knowledg 
 the animal figure takes, is when the rational innated matter 
 moves according to thole letters or notes, or wayes of divifion : 
 but in a confufed found there is no order, time, nor flop kept, 
 nor no perfed note, nor letter, nor line prick’d, or printed, or 
 drawn, but, as we vulgarly lay, it is all fcrible-fcrable, or elfe 
 ciphers let for notes ; and like as it is to the opticks, fo it is to 
 the ear, for the notes and letters, as the pidures which fade 5 
 for as the outward motions flacken , fo the vocal and ver- 
 bal found diffolves j and the memory and remembrance of 
 founds, vocal and verbal, is as the lenle of the objeds on the 
 opticks.

 I T is ftrange if we confider that one word fhould ftrike fo 
 many fevcral ears, and fo to be heard perfedly, by every 
 particular ear j but furely to my reafon one word or note can- 
 not fill lo many ears, as can ftand to hear it : again, it is 
 ftrange that a word fhould diredly hit into every ear that 
 ftands to hear it, I will not lay alwayes, for fometimes a 
 word isfpoke two or three times over, although the ear be 
 clear before it can hit the entrance, but that is but feldomej 
 - but in my opinion it is not a Angle word that runs about from 
 ear to ear, for then all would not hear at once, for if there 
 were a multitude, the laft ear might not hear a week after,

or at lead a day after it had been fpoken. 
 
 Wherefore in my opinion it muft be after this manner, 
 the mouth, tongue, and breath formes not onely a fmgle word, 
 but millions in one lump, with the lame labour oi pains, as 
 for one word ^ as for example, take a fheet of paper, or the 
 like, and fold it into many folds, in a fmall compafs, and ftamp 
 a print thereon, and every fold ihall have the like print with 
 one ftamp, and until they are parted they ftick fo dole as if 
 they were but one printed body, when every fold is divided by 
 the ftamp with the print thereon ; lo likewife the mouth folds 
 up thin air, and the tongue gives the printed ftamp, which be- 
 ing caft forth like a bali of wilde-fire, difperfeth in a crack or 
 found, and then fuddenly fpreads about in feveral ftreams; 
 thus millions of words run about in lines of air, pafting in all 
 pores and hollow bodies, as the ear or the like, concaves 
 as hollow wood and vaults, where finding refiftance, rebounds 
 back in repetitions, and according to their ftrength, or the 
 ftrength of their bearing motions, they pierce farther and fall 
 fhorter, and according to the freenefs of the paftage, they found 
 louder, clearer, lower, or duller, and according to their ftamp 
 they are perfed or imperfect. 
 
 After the lame manner is all diftind founds,* notes being 
 printed as words, but founds without diftindion, are like ftamps 
 without prints, that is plain pieces of air, but if the ear be 
 flopped, the found is loft to the brain, I will not fay to na- 
 tural fenfe, for furely the brain is not the whole ingrolfer of that 
 and the like lenfitive knowledg, neither will fay the animal 
 head ingroftes all that fort of tempered matter, or that no paf- 
 fage can conveigh a found but the animal ear. But moft pro- 
 bably all founds fpread as lights ; as for example, a Imall 
 candle will enlighten a large compafs, by reafon rayes of light 
 ftreame equally from the center candle to the circumference ; 
 fo is found : for when a piftol, or any the like fhots of a bullet, 
 the piftol, or that which makes the found, is the center which 
 fpreads found as fire doth light, and when fuch a compafs of 
 air is filled with found, either vocal or verbal, every ear that 
 ftands in the compafs muft needs receive the found if they be 
 not deaf 5 likewife every eye may fee day-light, that is not 
 blinde, and the rebounds of found are as the refredions of light, 
 and verbals are received into the ear, as figures into the eyes 5 
 and as crofs lines of light make various colours, fo different 
 notes make various tunes : But fome may fay, that if the air 
 were full of one and the fame words, or notes, that more would 
 enter the ears then was fent. 
 
 I fay that is impoftible, unlefs the ear could draw the fprea- 
 ding, or ftreaming lines from the circumference to a point, 
 which the ear cannot. 
 
 But I believe art may do the fame for found as it can with 
 light $ for art can draw with glaftes made for that purpofe,

 wanting in the animal figure, it is as we fay dead 5 that is, the 
 natural motion belonging thereto, is generally altered, or quite

 Belides, many times the radical moifture is carried out by 
 unnatural heats, and lometimes the vital fpirits by too many 
 tranlparations ; but thele pores paffages are drawn or lhut clo- 
 ler together by contracting motions, or fet wider open by ex-

 for the pores in this calc are as the tunnels of chimneys, where- 
 in the fmoke afeends up, and goeth out, and if they are fet too 
 wide open by the extenuating motions, they caui'e the body to

 by the fenfes, unto thofe parts that are created 
 therein, building thereon, and fitting there- 
 with, ftrengthning by adding thickneffe, as well as inlarging by 
 extention, yet all that is received into the ftomack,'is not nou-

 Chap. 1 6 8. Of the four natural Humours of the Body , 
 and tbofe that are inbred . 
 
 A S there is natural Fire, Aire, Water, and Earth, that is 
 made by an intire creation derived from their own pro- 
 per principles. 
 
 As likewife a metamorphofed Fire, Aire, Water, and 
 Earth. 
 
 So there are humours in Animal bodies, and in other bo- 
 dies ; for all I can perceive, and though the bodies cannot be 
 metamorphofed, yet the humours may. 
 
 But in every Animal body there is natural Melancholy, 
 C holer, Flegme,and blood; the natural blood is the vital 
 vapor ; the natural Flegme is the radical moifture ; the natural 
 C holer is the radical hear, the natural Melancholly is the a- 
 nimal fpirits, being the higheft extract. 
 
 And if we do but obferve thofe that be naturally melan- 
 cholly, have the founded judgements, the cleared underftand- 
 ing, the fubtileft oblervation, and curioufeft inventions, the 
 mod conceptions, the fined fancies, and the readied wits; like- 
 wife the ftrongeft pafiions, and mod conftant refolutior. 
 but humours which are inbred as tiegme, choler, and Melan- 
 choly are made as Metamorphofed fire, aire,water, dime mud, 
 and earth, as for example, the chylus is the matter that is me- 
 tamorphofed. 
 
 The dilating motions transform it from chylus to dime, 
 from dime to water, from water to blood, from blood 
 to vapor, from vapor to comfortable and lively heat, from 
 comfortable and lively heat, to burning fevers and heCtick 
 fevers, and the like. 
 
 Likewife the chylus by contracting motions, turns from chylus 
 to dime. 
 
 If they be cold contractions, it turns from dime to flegme, 
 from flegme to heavy melancholly. 
 
 If hot contractions, it turns from chylus to temperat choler ; 
 
 from

from temperat eholerto choler aduft, fromcholer aduft, to 
 melancholly; which from a flimy humour to a muddy humor, 
 from a muddy humour, to an earthy dry humour. 
 
 Some fort of hot contractions make it fharp, fome fait, fome 
 bitter. 
 
 Likewife,feveral forts of falts, fharpneffe, and bitternefle, 
 are wrought withmixt motions, cold contractions make the 
 humour, glafly, and ftony. 
 
 Hot contractions make the humours tough, clammy glutenous 
 and ftony. 
 
 Hot dilatings make the humour oylie, cold dilations 
 watry. 
 
 Likewife, mixt motions makes mixt humours, and mixt 
 tempers inclining to each ftde, as the motions predomi- 
 nate. 
 
 Chap. 1 69 The five natural Maladies ofi the body. 
 
 E Very difeafed figure is either pained, lick, diffy, numb, 
 weak, or mad, lometimes they meet all in one figure, 
 thefe are diftind fenfes one from another; as for pain, al- 
 though every feveral part of the body hath different lenfe, yet 
 they agree in the general, as to be all pain. 
 
 But fickneffe is quite different from pain, for it is another, 
 fenfe ; for to have a pain in the ftomach, is not to be ficke 
 in the ftomach ; neither is any part of the body, but the fto- 
 mach is liable to this fenfe; the head may ake, and the heart 
 may ake, heel, or any part of the body ; but none but the fto- 
 mach can be lick ; Indeed it is a different lenfe from pain. 
 Thirdly, a Iwimming, or difeales in the head, are different 
 from both the other, it is a third fort of lenfe, neither is any 
 other part of the body fubjeCt to this difeafe, but the head 
 not properly, yet faintneffe, or wcakneffe is a difeafe, as it 
 were tempered with the three former dileafes, as to have pain, 
 lick, and difty, or fwimming, to be mixt or compounded into 
 one difeafe, but it is fo mixt and compounded into all three, as 
 neither is perfectly or diftinCtly felt ; fo as it is no diftinCt fenfe 
 this dileale is general! to the whole body. The lift is mad- 
 neffe, this fenfe is neither painful, nor fick, nor difty, but light 
 in the head, which is different from difty or fwimming ; but 
 this difeafe infeCteth with a diftemper, the five outward fenfes. 
 The laft is a numbnefte, and deadnefle of particular parts ; 
 and fometimes of the whole body ; but this dileafe is not onely 
 a different fenfe, but an Other nature, which is naturally Un- 
 known to the figure ; for the figure is not any wayes fenfible 
 thereof ; indeed it is of the nature of fowning ; for thofe that 
 fown, the motions of the animal fenfe, and minde are quite 
 altered for a time, but then the animal motions return, that is, 
 rechanged to the proper motions again, fo that thole dead parts 
 
 The head ake 
 is different 
 from the

 or ftomack

 every parr, be 
 it never fo

that cannot be reftored to the fenfe of touch, are as it were in a 
 continual fown, for though in a fown the exterior motion are 
 proper to the fenfe of touch is changed, yet the interior moti- 
 ons proper to the confiftence, of that figure are not changed • 
 for if the interior confident motions were changed, it would 
 turn to alienaibn, fo in dead palfies, if the interior confiftent 
 motions were changed,thole parts would corrupt as do dead 
 carcafes. 
 
 Numb palfies, ie different from dead palfies as fainting from 
 fowning j for fainting is in the next degree to a fown , fo a

 banks.

 Like low mar- 
 fhy grounds. 
 
 Chap. 170. I will treat fir ft of the motions that wake jiamejj'e. 
 
 T He motions that caufe ficknes are different according as 
 the ficknes is, or rather the fickneffe is according to the 
 different motions^ for fome motions are like the ebbing and 
 Mowing tides of the fca j For the humor furdles, or folds 
 upwards, as the Mowing tide, which moft commonly provokes 
 to caft,as overMowing the mouth of the ftomack, but when 
 the humour folds backward,as the ebbing waters do, that pro- 
 vokes to the ftool j tor as falling tides run from one place, they 
 Mows to another, fo when the humour fals back from the 
 mouth of the ftomack, it overMows the belly , but if the hu- 
 mour neither overMows the belly, nor the mouth of the fto- 
 mack, it runs into the nerves, like as the water runs through 
 the earth, and as the water breaks forth by fprings, fo doth 
 the Humor by feveral rl eumes. 
 
 Again,fome lorts of fickneffe in the ftomack, are made by 
 fuch kinde of motions as water boyling in a pot, over the fire, 
 for as ebbing and Mowing motions are running backward, and 
 fo forward, fo boyling motions, are rifing upward, and fal- 
 ling downward, there is as much difference in thefe motions, 
 as betwixt vaughting and running^but thefe rifing motions caufe 
 vapours to the head, for the thin parts which rife higheft, when 
 their rifing ftrength fades, fall not haftily down again , but 
 gather to a more folid body, as vapor from the earth doht into 
 clouds, thefe clouds caufe the dimneffe and darknefte of the 
 fight, obftru&ing the light that is brought by theoptick 
 nerves. Again, there are "other forts of fickneffe in the 
 ftomack, caufed by fuch motions, as are like the rolling of a 
 barrel, the humour turning about in the figure of a barrel, 
 which figure, or the like, is fomewhat bigger in the middle, 
 then the two ends, this humour in the ftomack is moft com- 
 monly tough and thick, being more united, and fomtimes one 
 end of this humour is as fet upward , and the other down- 
 ward, and fo turned as a barrel with the head upward, and 
 fometimes moved as a barrel the longeft way on the ground, 
 thefe motions caufe neither purging by vomits, nor ftool, but 
 thruft out into cold fweats, for though thefe arc not fo ftrong 
 
 dilating

 dilating, or expulfing motions as ouer fiow 4 J , which forceth to 
 vomit, or to purge, yet it extenuates by thrufting weakly out 
 into a faint fweat, then there are other forts of ficknefs, 
 which are carried by fuch motions,as if meat were turning about 
 on a fpit, for the center of the humor removes not out of the 
 place, although the circumference turns about; this isacon- 
 ltailt iicknef , and the ftomach hath no eaie, untill the humor 
 is taken out oi the ftomach by iome ftronger motions ; as you 
 would take a ipit irom the tire, or by retentive motions, to 
 hold the humor from turning ; fo there are millions of feveral 
 motions, which makes feveral lickneifes in the ftomach , for 
 though the ftomach can be but lick, yet the licknels is not always 
 after one and the fame manner. 
 
 Chap. 1 7 1 . Of the motions which cauf e pains. 
 
 P A in is caufed not onely by irregular motions, but crofs 
 motions, or rather, as I may fay, jumbling motions ; that 
 is, motion beats upon motion, or, as 1 may fay, runs upon each 
 other, thronging and juftlingeach other; and feveral forts of 
 pain in feveral parts ol the body,are caufed by different, crols, 
 or beating motions, but if they be dilating motions, they beat 
 upon one another, by fhuHing outward, like as foolifh women 
 do for place, tumbling upon each other to get foremoft; 
 thofe painful motions turn to fores, and putrifie , becaufe di- 
 lating motions make moifture, and being perturbed, make 
 corruption, but if they be luch contracting motions which caufe 
 pains , they turn thofe parts that are pained to be harder, 
 then naturally thofe parts are, as the ftone dry liver, or brain, 
 or the like ; but if thofe pains be made of mixt motions, as 
 fome beat inward, and fome outward, and fo run crofs, 
 they are hard fwelling that extends to the exterior parts, but 
 will not break, as the King’s Evil, or Gouts that lie in the tlefh, 
 or Sciatica, and many the like; for though the extenuating 
 motions would burft out, yet the contracting motions keep in, 
 and being both equally ftrong, neither get the better, for the 
 time the pain is ; and if the pain be amongft the finews, it is 
 caufed either by contracting motions or dilating motions, but 
 not mixt, but as it were divided ; for if it be extenuating mo- 
 tions, the finews are irregularly ftretch’d too far ; if contract- 
 ing or atraCting motions, they irregularly draw, or pull, or ga- 
 ther the finews firings too fhort ; if the paines be in the bones, 
 they are onely crofs motions, as if one fhould run one againft 
 the other, yet neither fhuff backward nor pufh forwards, be- 
 ing equally ftrong ; if in the tlefh they are intangled motions, 
 which make it incline towards black, as to feem purple, or 
 read, or black. 
 
 And if the pain be in the skin, they are pricking motions, 
 as if a needle fhould draw a thread in and out upon a cloath,or

 D lffmefs and fwimming in the head is made byfeveral

 winde, if winde be condenfed, if not, it is rarihed vapor turn- 
 ed into winde 5 and the agilnefs of the motions therein, cauleth 
 the force thereof, by an often repetition, giving no time for 
 a repulfe ; but howfoever winde is made, either by rarification, 
 or condenfation, it is winde moft commonly, which caufeth 
 * 1 think it is t j iat we ca p a fwimming and diflinefs in the head ; * for this 
 becaufe it is condenfed or rarihed vapor, ( which you will ) when it is ex- 
 foeafiiy dif- pulfed, flies violently about, carrying or driving whatfoever 
 pcrc ‘ is bearable, loole or moveable along, or about with it, accor- 
 ding to the ftrength thereof ; and if this winde be in thofe veins 
 which incompals and run through the brain , it carries the 
 bloud therein, with fuch an extraordinary and fwift motion 
 about the head, or brain, as it carries the fenfes, as it were, 
 along with it, which makes the difeafed thir.k the brain turned 
 round in the head, when it is onely the vapor, that wheels 
 round therein, or about ^ but the lafting ftrength wafting by 
 the violent fwittnefs, brings but a fhort trouble to the difeafed, 
 and feldom or never caufeth a ruine, unlefs there be fome vein 
 broken by the violence thereof ; but if it be a windy vapor, in 
 the follower and larger parts of the head, it fometimes will 
 gather like a ball, or like that we ca 1 a fp inning top, which 
 lpins about in the brain, whileft it hath ftrength, and when the 
 ftrength fails, the fpinning motion is done, and the vapor di- 
 fperfeth, fo the diflinefs ceafeth $ at other times thofe vapors 
 will move like awhiriwinde, moving afcendingly, in leffer 
 and leffer circles, until it brings a circle to a point in the fhape 
 of a pyramid 5 and when the ftrength abates, or that it breaks it 
 felf againft more folid matter, the vapor difperfes and fo ex- 
 pulfes, but this fort of motions is fo violent, as it caufes the di- 
 leas’d to fall, but foon to recover, for what is iupernaturally 
 violent cannot laft long.

 turns round, but fo as it turns round with the head, as one part, 
 not in the head as a part by it felf ; and the reafon that the dif- 
 fineis is cured by turning the contrary way, is, that the fenfitive 
 motions therein are turned toward their moderate, naturall, 
 and accuftomed manner of moving ; for the violence of turn- 
 ing round, forces the fenfitive motions, as the winde doth the 
 air, or water, driving all one way, as before it, or rather like The flr 0ngc *

 lmews, and fmall fibres of the body, which are like laths to an 
 houie, and flefh like the morter laid thereon. The bones like 
 the ftrong timber rafters and beams therein, which when the

Chap. 17 6. Of numb and dead palfies. 
 
 A Dead palfie is not onely made by mif-tempered matter, 
 and diiordered motions, but by unnatural motions, as 
 improper to the nature of that kinde of figure, working, or 
 mil-working moft commonly upon the exterior parts, drawing 
 up or {hutting dole thofe paffages that fhould be open, work- 
 ing by contrary motions, from the nature of the figure, which 
 caufes infenfibility, but as long as the vital parts be untouch’d, 
 which are the ftewards, and truftees, to the life of the body, 
 which are to difpofe, difcharge, and direCt, to take in and lay 
 out, for the fubfiftance of the body ( as I may fay ) as long as 
 thele are untouch’d, the life of the body may lubfifl, although 
 the other particular parts be as we fay dead, or loft to the na- 
 tural ufe of the body. A numb palfie is of the fame nature, 
 but not of the fame degree ; as for comparifon, a dead palfie 
 is, as if a door, for common and neceffary paftage, fhould be 
 clofe fhut and lock’d, or nail’d up ; and a numb palfie is as if 
 the door or doors fhould be half operr, and according as it is 
 open, or {hut, the numb palfie is more or Ids, but botli dead ; 
 and numb palfies are occafioned by fome unnatural contracti- 
 ons, for if it were by fome unnaturall expulfions, the parts in- 
 feCted would rot, and fall from the other parts, as gangrenes, 
 which certainly are caufed by fuch kind of unnatural expulfiom, 
 as dead palfies are of unnatural contractions } thus we finde by 
 experience, that they are unnatural contractions, that caufe 
 dead palfies, becaufe they do not rot. 
 
 Wherefore in thefe difeafes there muft be applied opening 
 medicines that work dilatively, and if they be caufed from a 
 cold contraction, then hot dilating medicines muft be applied, 
 but if they proceed from hot contractions, the cold dilating 
 medicines muft be applied ; but the difficulty and skill will be 
 to finde whether they proceed from cold, or heat, although 
 moft commonly , all bhyficians do apply in thefe difeafes , 
 very hot and dry medicines, which are contracting, which me- 
 dicines are quite contrary to the nature of the dif eafes, which 
 makes them cure fo few, but the fureft way is to apply dilating 
 medicines, whether hot or cold. 
 
 Chap. 177. Of that we call a Jleepy numbnef. 
 
 A Sleepy numbnefs is alfo caufed by obftruCtion or ftop- 
 pages ; as for example, if any over-burthenfome weight 
 {ies up6n the arm, or hand, or the like, it will become numb, 
 which is vulgarly called fleepy ; the reafon is, that preffing too 
 hard upon thofe parts, we {top the pores, which by touch is re- 
 ceived 5 for if the pores be clofe {hut, touch cannot enter, no 
 more then if the eye be {hut an outward object can enter, or

 flopping the ears, or nofe, a found, or fcent can enter $ as we 
 may finde by experience ; for if any part is bound too hard, it 
 ftrait becomes numb, likewife a violent blow 5 or when any 
 part is tied too hard, that part becomes numb, the reafon is, 
 by firiking or thralling back the bloud $ for the bloud. is like 
 a running company, which when they are forcibly beaten back, 
 on thofe companies that are thralling forward, unite by con- 
 traction into lo firm a body, that no particular part can ftir 5 
 which folid and thick body flops the pores of the fleih, and the 
 running motions in the veinesjbut alfo as we give liberty by uni- 
 ting, or unbinding, or by taking off waight, or by gently rub- 
 bing, to open the pores, and dilperfe the bloud, it is cured. 
 
 L ikewife the fleepy numbnels may proceed from a fuper- 
 fiuity of vapor, which hying to the pores for vent may flop the 
 palfage, by too great a concourfe, being more vapor then hid- 
 den vent j but any alteration of motion cures it, by difperling 
 the vapor, more thin and evenly. 
 
 Chap. 178. Of the he Ad feeling numb. 
 
 W Hen the skins which wrap up the brain, as the pia mater 3 
 and dia mater , are contracted by an inward cold, or an 
 outward cold taken in at the nofe, ears, mouth, or pores of 
 the skin, they fhrivel, or are drawn in as a handkerchief, or the 
 like 5 when we carry fome bulk within it, and when thofe 
 skins are drawn into a liraiter compafs, then the nature is, it 
 prelfes upon the brain, as being too ftrait, wherein the brain 
 cannot freely move. 
 
 Befides, the veins and little fmall firings that run about 
 the brain, being contracted with cold, the bloud in thofe veins 
 cannot fo freely run, and thofe firings being fhrunk, make the 
 brain feel as if it were fo hard bound, as to be numb 5 but this 
 doth rather alright the life of the difeafed, then deftroy it * for 
 a little warmth by rubbing the head, or a hot cloth laid on the 
 head, or fome warm fpoon-meat cures it. 
 
 Alfo numbnefs may proceed from too much bloud in the 
 veins, or too much matter in the nerves,for being too full caufeth 
 a flopping, for wantoffpace or room to move naturally in 5 
 but this numbnefs is not fo eafily cured, efpecially when the op- 
 preiTions lie in the nerves, for opening a vein gives liberty to 
 the bloud 5 but I know not how one fhould fo eafily open a 
 nerve, neither is the matter within fo liquid, as fuddenlyto 
 run out $ but this numbnefs is rather of the nature of a dead 
 numbnefs, then a fleepy numbnefs.

 fenfitive door, as if awake, although there are no obje&s to 
 take pattern from, as we may perceive by them that are di- 
 ftempered, that they fee fuch objects that are not prefent, or 
 fuch as never was, or can be 3 and fo the like for founds, tads,

 works regular, they never draw on the outfide without a pat- 
 tern, but on the infide, as in deep, and the like for ad the other 
 fenfes : But the motions of the rational madnefs are, when they 
 move violently, and irregularly, if the motions be onely vio- 
 lent, then they fall into violent paifions 3 as anger, fear, malice, 
 or loving, hating, grieving, difpraifes, and refolute intentions 3 
 if their motions be irregular, then they have drange concepti- 
 ons, wild fancies, mixt memories, incondant and various opi-

 drong and drange imaginations, high defpaires, obdinate and 
 dangerous refolutions 3 if the fenfitive and rational innate mat-

 talkc, laugh, fing, weep, and figh, without reafon why, or 
 wherefore 3 but midake me not, for when I fay, too violent, 
 drong, fwift, weak, flow, it is irregular, as to the temper or

motions, as for example an army is to march in a body, and 
 lome fhould go, or ride half a day, or a dayes journey before 
 the reft, and fome fhould lag, and come (lowly behinde, or that 
 fome fhould go one way , and fome another, or as two 
 fhould carry a burthen, and the hindemoft fhould go too faft 
 for the former, and fo tumble or throw down, or as horfes

 long not to them , or inftead of garding a houfe pull it down, 
 or like thole that will make a fire in the midft of the houfe 
 on a woodden floor, and not in the Chimnie ; then there is 
 a dilorder in placing, and matching of parts, and alterati- 
 ons of motions, quite different, from the nature of the figure, 
 for fome fort of madnes is made by fuch different motions, 
 as death from that which we vulgarly call life, that is, the 
 motions, are as different, as feveral kindes of figures ; for in 
 this kinde of madncffe, they no more know in their fits, or 
 remember out of their fits, what they did , or laid, or was 
 done to them in their fits, then if they had been dead } juft as 
 in a found, they know not what was done to reftore them, yet 
 there is not a ceffation of motions $ neither in the fenfitive, 
 nor in the rational, but an alteration of motion, ’tis true, there 
 is for a time a cellation of fuch forts of motion, as belong to 
 the naturaf health of the figure, but not to the life* 
 
 Chap. 180. Of tnadnejje in the body and minde. 
 
 T Here are two iorts different in madneffe, the one is irregu- 
 lar motion, amongft the rational innated matter, the o- 
 ther amongft the fenfitive innated matter , as mifplacing, ill 
 mixing, or mifmixing, or miftempering, or diftempering, falfe 
 carving, wrong printing off, and on the dull part of matter, 
 as in fevers, or the like difeales, where the diltempered mat- 
 ter is mifplaced, by which improper motions, alters the na- 
 tural motions, which makes the natural temper, and cauieS, 
 and unnatural temper by improper motions ; working upon 
 every particular fenfe, irregularly, or rather improperly, and 
 mixtly, which makes extra \ agancies both in each particular 
 fenfes, and in the generality, this madneffe proceeds from the 
 fenfitive, and not from the rational innated matter ; for the 
 rational part will be in order, and deferibe diftindtly what 
 extravagant the fenfe prefents to them 5 but this madneffe 
 of the body is oft times miftaken, and thought to be the diftem- 
 per of the minde, becaufe the fick perfons deferibe thofe ex- 
 travagancies by relation, yet oftimes the one caufeth the other, 
 but not alwayes for many times the' minde will be diforde- 
 red when the body is found, and healthful, and many times the 
 body will be diftempered, when the minde is regular and frees

 but the madneffe of the body , onely continues to the height 
 of the difeafe, and as the diieafe abates, the extravagancies 
 vades, and by health vanifhes away, or rather is rubbed, or 
 worn out, by the Regular, and proper natural motions be- 
 longing to mat figure, or body, but the madneffe in the minde 
 proceeds from irregular motions, amongft the rational innated

 innated mat- <jiftempcr,or rather that difordcr, is altogether in the mo- 
 ving matter, when the other diftemper is in dilordering the mo- 
 ved matter, for the fenfitive innate matter may work regu- 
 larly, according to the nature and ft rength , but not according 
 to the temper, or degree of the dull matter, nor according to 
 the nature, and property of the kinde, or fort of figure; but 
 when the fenfitive , and the rational joyns in conjugal diforder 
 the minde is ravening as we fay, and the body weak. 
 
 Chap. 1 8 1 . Madaes is not a I w ayes about the bead, 
 
 M Adneffe belongs not onely to the head, as that onely the 
 eye, ear, nofe, and mouth, fees, hears, frnels, and tafts 
 in mad fits, extravagantly; but every other part of the body that is fen- 
 
 lible of touch ; for extravagant touch, is as much as extrava- 
 vant fight, and the like ; for touch of the breft, or any other 
 part of the body, is a fenfe, as much as the eye in the head ; 
 thus the body, or fenfes will be mad as well as the minde, 
 as I have defcribed in former chapters* 
 
 Likewife for the madneffe in tne minde, it is not alwayes 
 bound in the head ; for where there are extravagant pafftons 
 in the heart, the minde is as mad, as when there are extra- 
 \ agant imaginations, in the head ; for the rational matter, that 
 which we call the foul, or minde is as much, and hath as much 
 recourfe to the heart, as to the head, and fo to the other parts 
 of the body, for any thing lean perceive. 
 
 But that matter I call the rational and fenfitive fpirits, 
 * which others call the animal, and vital fpirits; perchance 
 * if I miftake fools may think me extravagant for giving the matter other 
 not. names ; but I was forced to take thefe names, becaufe they 
 
 were more fignificant to the fenfe of my difeourfe ; befides, 
 perchance they may think, when I fpeak of rational and fenft- 
 tive fpirits, that they are hobgoblins, ghofts, or vifions, fuchas 
 nurfes fright their children with, or fuperftitions, or as the 
 wifer fort doth to make credulous fools beleeve to keep them in

 T Here is great reafon why Mufick {hould cure madnefle;for 
 this fort of madneffe is no other but the fpirits that are

 fpirits having a natural fympathy with Mufick, may be compo- 
 sed into their right order; butitmuftbe fuch Mufick, as the 
 number of the notes muft goe in fuch order as the natural mo-

 motion, but are fet like notes to feveral tunes.* wherefore if it 
 were poffible, to fet notes to the natural motion of the heart, or 
 that brain that is diftempered, it might be perfectly cured, but 
 as fome notes docompofe the brain by a iympathy to the na- 
 tural motion, fo others do make a difcord or antipathy, and 
 difcompofe it, putting the natural motions out of tune.

 HT Here are many feveral forts or manners of fevors;but I will 
 onely treat of the fundamental fevours, which are three, 
 from which three all other fevors are partly derived; the firft is 
 a malignant fevor,the fecond the he&ive fevor;and the third the 
 ordinary burning fevours ; the firft is catching, and often dead- 
 ly, the fecond is never catching, but alwayes deadly; the third is 
 neither catching 5 and feldom deadly;the firft proceeds from vi- 
 olent difordered motions, and diftenipered matter, and humour. 
 
 The fecond from fwift motions, which diftemper and make 
 wafte of the matter, which matter, I mean the fubftance of the 
 body. 
 
 The third is too violent motions on well tempered 
 matter. 
 
 And thefe three forts of fevours are often mixt, as it were 
 a part of all mixt into one ; but a high ^malignant fevor, is a 
 fudden ufurpation ; for the difordered motions joynedwitha 
 miftempered matter, which is corrupt humours, furprife 
 the body, and deftroy the life therein, as we fhall fee in 
 great plagues, the body is well, fick, and dead in a moment; 
 thefe or the like difeafes are caufed after three manner of 
 Wayes, as being taken from outward infedt ion, or bred by an 
 evil habit in the body , or by taking fome difagreeing mat- 
 ter therein, which caufeth a war of iickneffe ; for upon the 
 diforder which the difagreeing matter makes, the natural mo- 
 tions belonging to the body grow factious, and like a com-

 thofe they can over power, to turn rebels to the life of the

 For it is againft the nature of the innated matter to be 
 idle, wherefore it works rather irregularly then not work at 
 all,but as long as a body lies Tick, the power is divided, one part 
 of the innated matter working irregularly, the other according 
 to the natural conftitution, which by the regularity, they ftrive 
 to maintain the chief forts of life which are the vital parts, efpe- 
 cially the heart, and difordered motions driving to take, or 
 pull them down, making their ftrongeft affaults thereon 5 for 
 the difordered innated matter makes out-works of corrupted 
 matter, flopping as many paffages as their power will give 
 leave, fo driving either to darve the vital parts, or to oppreffe 
 them with corruption, or to burn them by their unnatural heat 
 they make in the body,or to drown them with watrifh humor 
 which is caufed by the didemper of ill difgedions, and 
 obftruCtions; the regular innated matter, drives to break down 
 thofe works, and to cad, and expel that filth out of the body,

 Chap. 1 8 7. The remedies of Malignant Dif eaf es. 
 
 I N malignant difeafes expelling medicines are belt, which 
 expelling medicines are not hot, and dry medicines, for all 
 drugs that are naturally dry, have a contracting quality 
 which is an utter enemy in this diieafe; for they muft be di- 
 lating medicines, and all dilating medicines have a fluid faculty 
 working after the nature of a flowing tide, which is thrufting, 
 or ftreaming outward, as to the circumference, and the opera- 
 tions of drying medicines, are like the ebbing tide that draws 
 backward or inward, as to it felf; but as I laid before, that 
 all hot and dry medicines have a contracting quality, which 
 contractions draw or gather up the malignity, as in a bundle 
 or heap together, and if it be a fiery contraction, it fets it on 
 a fire, which burns out the life of the body ; for fire makes no 
 diftinguifhment of good or bad, but deftroyes all it can in 
 compaffe, fo as it will not oneiy burn up the fuperfluities, or 
 corruptions, but luck or drink up the radical moifture, or char- 
 coales, the vital parts, and conlumes the animal life. Wherefore 
 dilating medicines, muft be applied in thefe difeafes, but not 
 ftrong expulfives medicine , by reafon the malignity is lb in- 
 termixt , or fpread in the,body that ftriving with a ftrong force 
 to caft forth the malignity they fhould caft forth the nourifh-

 draw the malignity more Irom the vital parts into the veins, 
 for the veins having a natural quality or faculty to draw, and to 
 luck into them, will draw, and fuck in that which doth molt 
 abound, lo as it is but ftiil letting blood as the malignity is 
 drawn in, for it is better to let out the blood, then endanger 
 the vital parts, by keeping it in, for if mo ft of the blood fhould 
 bee let out there will frelh blood increal'e in a fhort time, but 
 if the vital parts be never fo little corrupted, or putrified or 
 wafted, we cannot heale or make up thole parts again. 
 
 Chap. I34. Difeafel. cAufed by conceit, or cured. 
 
 A S for the Producing difealcsby conceit, is thus 3 the vi- 
 tal fpirits which arc the motions ol life, have an abfo- 
 lute power over the body, as working every part thereof, and 
 therein, fo the animal fpirits which are the motions of the mind 
 create imaginations, and conceptions, and the animal fpirits 
 and the vital fpirits being as man and wife, the animal as the 
 husband, the vital fpirits as the wife, whereupon the animal 
 fpirits many times beget that deleafe it figures which is an 
 imagination , and the vital fpirits brings that childe forth, 
 beino- like the figure the animal fpirits made, that is, the vital 
 fpirits oft times work fuch motions as makes fuch difeafes, 
 wherefore the animal fpirits work thole motions into imagina- 
 tions ; and to prove it, tiiol'e that conceit they fhall have the 
 fmall pox, mealels, pleague, or the like, moll commonly they 
 fall fick of that difeafe, although they come not neer the infecti- 
 on 3 and to prove the animal fpirits which is the minde, works 
 the fame motions by an imagination as the difeale is, that thole 
 which conceit a difeafe, do not fall lick of any other difeafe 
 but the lame they imagine, and the reafon why thefe malig- 
 nant difeafes are produced oftner by imaginations then other 
 difeafes, is, that thole dileafes are dangerous, or that they are 
 apt to deform which makes a fearlul conception or imaginati- 
 on, to work more ftrongly 5 for did the imiginations work as 
 ftrong to other dileafes as to thefe, they would produce the 
 lame elfeCfs 3 As for thole which are cured by conceit, is when 
 the motion of the animal fpirits works ftronger then the vital 
 fpirits, which caufeth the vital fpirits to altar thole motions 
 that made fuch difeafes 3 but thole effeCts are produced but 
 feldom, by reafon that the animal Ipirits feldom work lo 
 ftrong imaginations, for it requires a double, or treble ftrength 
 to refill or alter the force another way, which muft be to cure 
 a difeafe after this manner, then to joyn and aiTift,as in the pro-

 ducing a difeafe ; for when the imagination produceth a dif- 
 eafe, the vital fpirits joyn with the animal, but when the dif- 
 eale is cured by imagination, the animal fpirits takes the ani- 
 mals from their work ; but a great fright, or a hidden joy is a 
 good remedy in lome difeales, by' realon thole pailionate mo- 
 tions are ftrong, and violent, yet they can cure onely loole 
 difeafes,not fuch dileales as are rooted, or fixt, for then the vital 
 lpirits are not to be altered by the animal. 
 
 Chap. 1 8 8. Of the expelling malignity to the outward 
 parts of the body. 
 
 T He reafon why malignant difeales, as the plague, or pur- 
 ples, or Imall pox, meafels, or the like 5 there break 
 form Ipots, fwelling fcabs, or whelks, is by the power of ex- 
 pelling motion ; But the reafon why it Hicks in the flefh, and 
 not quite out, is, becaufe the irregular motions that maintain 
 the health and ftrength of the body, are oppoled by diforder- 
 ly motions, which makes corrupted matter, that makes difor- 
 dered motions ; for though there can be no corrupted matter, 
 but what is caufed from difordered motion, yet when the hu- 
 mors of the body are once corrupted, the motions are more 
 violent j again , fuperabundant humors , caufe difordered 
 motions 5 lor as there is too much humor, obftru&ing the bo- 
 dy therewith, ' lo there is too much motion, to work regularly 
 therein, and being againft the natural conftitution to have lo 
 much humor, and motion, it produceth violent ficknels, work- 
 ing to the deftruction, and not to the maintenance ol the body ; 
 but the regular motions, which are digeftive motions, which 
 unites, ftrengthcns, and defends the vital parts, by atrabting 
 good nourilhment, by retaining the uletui parts 5 by con- 
 cocting it into a follid lubftance, by expelling of luperduieties, 
 ormaiignancy out of the body, after a methodical manner, and 
 according as the ftrength of expelling motions are, lo is the 
 malignity, call forth, tor if the repelling motions be ftronger 
 then the expelling motion, the malignant preffesr fo hard upon 
 the vital parts, as it {mothers the life therein, or burns up the 
 materials thereof : Again, the expelling motions may be fo 
 weak, as they cannot thruft out the malignity lo far as the cir- 
 cumference of the body which is the skin, or it fo far, yet not 
 to ftay there fo long, as to evapor it out, and then the malig- 
 nity fals back with a greater violence $ for what is forced, and 
 relifteth, when once it bath liberty, or gets power, it becomes 
 more violent, by how much more it were forced ; but that 
 malignity that doth evaporate forth, doth infeniibly enter into 
 the next body it meets 5 entring through the noftrils, mouth, 
 or pores of the flefh ^ and thus many times, from animal to 
 animal untill there is a general infection, which is a general 
 diforder, for the malignity that enters in by infection, is like a

 foraign enemy, which enters into a peaceable country, which 
 not onely diforders it, but makes havock and wafte, and many 
 times utterly deftroyes it, but when a malignant diieaie is bred 
 in the body, it is like a civil war, where uproars are rafted, 
 and outrages are done, by inbred corrupt humors 3 but when 
 malignant or other difeafes are caufed by furfeits, it is like a 
 deluge of fire or water, that either drowns, or burns up the 
 the kingdom of the body 3 where fometimes it is faved by af-

 Chap. 189. Of Sweating difeafes. 
 
 A L L fweating dileaies are caufed by fuch kinde of ex- 
 tenuating motions, as melt metal, and not by fuch kinde 
 of extenuating motions as evaporate water, for the evapora- 
 tions of the watery part of the body breath forth in infenfible 
 tranlpirations, as breathing through the pores like a thin air 3 
 but fweat runs through the pores like liquid oar through gutters 
 of earth : but fvveats are good or bad for the body, according 
 to the matter or humors that are melted out, as lor example 3 
 I will compare the humors of the body to feveral metals, as 
 Iron, Lead, Tin, Copper, Silver and Gold 5 Iron is melan- 
 cholly duff 3 Lead is cold, and dry or cold, and moift melan- 
 choly Tin is flegm- Copper is choler; Silver is the radi- 
 Jh- O cal humor 3 and Gq^Us the vital fpirits: Thcfe humors muft 
 be proportionably tempered to make a healthful body 3 there 
 muft not be too much quantity of Lead, Tin, or Copper, for 
 -the Silver or Gold, but unlels there be fome, they will 
 not work 3 like as coyn , it cannot be wrought, or formed 
 without lome allay, and if the allay be too much, it abates the 
 coyn. 
 
 Likewife there muft be fo much heat in the body onely as 
 to compound thofe humors, not to melt them out by fweats 
 unlefs they fuperabound3 and then Phyiicians muft onely have a 
 care to melt out that humor that fuperabounds3for if the radical 
 humor fhould be melted, or the vital fpirits fpent, it deftroys 
 the body by wafting the life. 
 
 But in fome cafes fweating is very beneficial to the body, as 
 in great colds, which have knit up the pores or paffages of the 
 body, or in great furfeits, or in malignant difeales, which 
 help to expel the poyfonous humor, or corrupted humors in 
 the body, or melt the Icy humors congeal’d by cold 3 but thofe 
 fweats that are beneficial, and wholefome tor the body, the 
 body will be much ftronger, and agiler, and the fpirits quicker, 
 and livelier, 3 but thofe lweats that are pernicious to the body, 
 the body will be faint and weak, after they have fweat 3 but in 
 thefe difeafes, a phyfician muft be very careful, when he puts 
 a patient in a fweat, as to give fuch medicines as will work up- 
 on

bn that humor, he would have fweat forth, but in fweating db 
 feafes, as when the body fweats too violently, like as in great 
 and dangerous fluxes, which are not to be ftaied by ordinary 
 means, tor although in thefe difeafes, there muft be ufed con- 
 trading medicines, yet tome lweats require hot contracting 
 medicines, others cold contracting medicines, and thofe medi- 
 cines that are applied, muft be applied gently, and by degrees, 
 left by a fudden contraction they Ihould ftop the pores of the 
 body too much, which are the doors to let out the irnoak in the, 
 body, as well as the tweat of the body, or by too hafty con- 
 tractions thofe paffages fhould be fhut, that fhould be kept 
 open, or thole to be kept opened that fhould be fhut j but phy- 
 ficians will guefs by the patient, what humor they fweat forth ; 
 for cold fweats are front melancholy, clammy fweats from 
 thick flegm; hot burning fweat from choler; cold faint 
 fweats proceed from the radical humor 5 hot faint fweats front 
 the vital fpirits. 
 
 Chap. Ipo. Of Surfeits. 
 
 S llrfeits are luperfluities 5 as too much heat, or too much

 tity of meat, or drink, or the like. Like wife when the nature 
 of the meat is difagreeing to the nature of the body • where 
 one fcruple will be too much, as being ill, which will give a 
 forfeit , for forfeits do not onely opprefs by the fuperfluous 
 quantities of matter, but difturb by the fuperfluous motions* 
 the dilagreeing matter cauling more motion, then naturally 
 belonges to a healthful body • Befides, like a company of rude 
 and unruly ftrangers difturbs and hinders the irregular motions,; 
 altering the natural conftitutions, and uniformity of the body ; 
 and many times mines the body, unlefs an afliftant motion in 
 medicinable matter is brought to help, to expel the fuperfluous, 
 or that the natural expulfive motions in the body, are ftrong 
 enough , to throw out that ill matter , either by vomit, or 
 ftoole, or other evacuation ; but many times the luperfluities 
 become lo ftrong, not onely by their own ill nature, or great 
 quantity, but by making a faction 5 And fo begetting a party 
 amongft the natural motions, which makes foch a general dif- 
 order, that though the natural digeftive motion, and the na- 
 tural expullive motion joyn with the like alfiftant motions taken 
 in medicines , yet the body fhall be ruinated, and life caft 
 out, by that matter, and thefe motions that are their enemies

 Chap. 1 pi. Of fonfumptions. 
 
 A L L Confumptions are caufed by an unnatural expulfion, 
 caufed by miftempered matter, or miftempered matter 
 caufed by unnatural motions, fuch as work not to the fubfiftance 
 or health of the body 5 which after they have corrupted the 
 matter, they turn to expulfions, throwing all out of the body ^ 
 but if they be onely exterior expulfions, they onely untile the 
 houfe, that is, they do unfiefh the body 5 but if they be inte- 
 riour expulfions, they do not onely unfiefh the body, but rot 
 fome part in the body 5 and if the unnatural expulfions be 
 amongft the vital parts, which are the foundations of the life 
 of the body , the whole fabrick of the body fals without 
 redemption, and the materials go to the building of other 
 figures. 
 
 But if they are hot expulfions, caufed from a thin, {harp, 
 fait humor, there muft be applied cold contracting medicines ; 
 and if they be cold expulfions,there muft be apylied hot contra- 
 cting medicines. 
 
 All cold expulfions are, when the parts are tender, weak 
 and raw, and undigefted 5 and hot expulfions are, when me 
 parts are burnt, or ulcerated } for all hot expulfions work 
 upon the parts of the body, as fire on wood when they are bur- 
 ning expulfions, or elfe like as fire doth on metal, melting 
 them into a liquid fubftance ; and cold expulfions work upon 
 the parts, as when cloudes beat down into fhowers of rain, 
 or flakes of fnow, breaking or extenuating thole clouds into 
 fmall parts, lo that the dropfical humor that arileth from hot 
 confumptions, are onely liquid like melted metal j and the 
 dropfical humdr that arifeth from cold confumptions, is as a 
 watery ftoud : but as I laid, in all confumptions the remedies 
 muft be contractive, or at leaft retentive 5 becaufe the nature of 
 ail confumptions are expulfive, but yet all or the moft part of 
 phyficians, finding their patients to be lean and dry, give all 
 dilative medicines, as if the parts were onely gathered into a 
 lefs compafs ; but the truth is, when lo much of the natural 
 bulk of the body is leffened, fo much of the body is wafted : 
 I will not fay but thefe unnatural expulfions might proceed 
 from unnatural contractions, like as when any thing is made fo 
 dry as it moulders into duft, but when it comes to that degree, 
 it expulfes ; fo whenfoever the body is in a confumption, the 
 motions therein are expulfive : I do not mean by liege or vo- 
 mit, although they will fpit much, which is a kinde of vomi- 
 ting, but they wafte by infenfible infpirations j but all purging 
 medicines are an enemy to this difeafe, unlefs they be very gen- 
 tle'- for though purging medicines do not expulfe, after the 
 nature of confumptive expulfions,. yet if they be ftrong, they 
 
 may

 may in lome kinde aflift the confumptive expulfions, neither 
 is much leting blood good in thefe difeafes ; yet a little re- 
 frelhes , and tempers the body } for in thele difeafes phyli- 
 tians muft do as Chirurgions when they cure wounds, they 
 firft clenfe the fore or wounds, taking away the putrified 
 matter gently with a probe, and then lay a healing plainer, 
 fo Phyfitians mult gently purge and bleed the patient, and 
 then give them ftrengthening, and nourilhing remedies: again 
 many Phyfitians have a rule, that when they perceive their 
 patient to be exteriorly dry, that is, outwardly dry, they 
 think them hot } but it doth not follow that all drouth 
 proceeds from heat} for there are cold drouths as well as hot, Aj witnefi t 
 fo that a Phylician muft warily obferve the patients drouth, the froft and 
 whether it proceeds from cold or heat, or whether the drouth ice- 
 proceeds for want of a fufticient quantity of matter, for the 
 body to feed upon, or that the matter, which properly fhould 
 be porous and lpungy, is contracted into an unnatural folidi- 
 ty, and though the interior nature of drought is made by con- 
 traction, yet the exterior motions may be expullive 5 as for 
 example, if any thing is dryedto that degree as to fall into 
 duft, although the interior be contracting, that cauled it to be 
 fo dry, yet the exterior motions are expullive, that caufethit 
 to fall into parts} but the drouth of confumptions doth proceed 
 molt commonly from a fcarcity of nourifhing matter that 
 fhould feed each part of the body, for the principal and con- 
 tinent parts being diftempered, cannot dilgeft fo much as will 
 feed the hungry members therof } but as I have faid before* 
 that all confumptions are wrought by expullive motions, for 
 what is contracted, is not confumed,nor doth conlume untill 
 it expulfes, but thofe bodies that are lean or dry by contra- 
 ctions, are not in confumptions, for nothing is wafted, onely 
 the dimenfioir, and extentions of the body are drawn into a 
 leffer, compalfe } Thus, as I have faid, Phyfitians , although 
 they miftake not the difeales, yet they may eahly miftake the 
 manner of the difeales, for one and the fame kinde of difeales 
 may move after divers manners in feveral bodies, and in one 
 and the fame body.

 they dilate after that manner, as the other expulles, elpecial- 
 iy if they are dropfies, which proceed from corrupt parts, 
 and then they turn to confumptive expulfions, and the onely' 
 difference in moft dropfies, and confumptions, is, that dropfies 
 as long as that difeafe lafts, the motions in the body are moft 
 dilating, which is in a degree to expul lion, and when it comes 
 to a confumption they are all expulfions, but as the motions

 difcyfo {he difeafes differ, for there are feveral forts of dila- 
 tions,and feveral forts of expulfions, nay fome are different in 
 the manner of working, as if they were of other kindes of 
 motions, but fomedropfies proceed from hot dilations,others 
 from cold dilations , and fome proceed from too many di- 
 geftive motions, that is, when there are too many or too ftrong 
 difgeftive motions in the body 5 for the natural temper of the 
 body difgefts'fo faft, as makes more nourifhment, then the 
 feveral parts can feed with temperance , which makes the 
 reignes, and the reft of the fucking parts glutinous, or elfe 
 thole many difgefting motions work too curious, for by rea- 
 lon they cannot be idle, they work the nourishing matter too 
 fine, or too thin, for proper ules ; as if flower fhould be fo of- 
 ten bolted, that it could not work into a lump, or batch for 
 bread 5 or like as any thing fhould be wrought upon fo much, 
 as to become liquid, as into oyl or water. " 
 
 Other dropfies proceed from the weaknefte of difgeftion,thofe 
 motions being not ftrong, or fufficient to work all that is 
 brought into the ftomach ; whereupon that fuperfluous matter 
 corrupts with diftempered motions, and when it comes to be 
 corrupted, it either dilates, or expul les, if it onely dilates, it 
 turns to water, if expullive, it cafts forth, either by vomit or 
 ftool, or elfe lies to corrupt the principal parts in the body, 
 which when they are joyned together, expulles life by their 
 treacherous ufurpation. 
 
 Other dropfies are cauled by too weak contracting motions, 
 caufing that to be tender that fhould be folid, or thofe parts 
 loofe that fhould be firm, as not contracting hard enough. 
 As firft contracting into Cnylus, then into blood, then harder, 
 for flefh, and harder lor nerves and bones ; the contractions 
 growing weaker and weaker, until they become of no ftrength, 
 and then they turn to dilations or expulfions ; but pray mi- 
 ftake me not, for though one and the lame innate matter may 
 grow weaker, as to abate of fuch or luch a kinde of motion, io 
 incre^fes ftronger and ftronger, according to the quantity, as 
 to-other motions. But as I laid before, that innated matter in 
 fuch difeafed bodies, turns from contracting to dilating, tur- 
 ning by-degrees from one to another, and then the dilations 
 work more and more, extending more and more in fuch cir- 
 cular jflotions as produce water ; for when it comes to luch 
 a degree of extention, it is become from being folid to be lelfe 
 ha{d, trom being lefie hard, to be foft, from foft to be li- 
 quid, Jrom liquid fluid, and when it comes to fuch a de- 
 gree of a fluid extention, it turns wet, and when it is foft, li- 
 quid, fluid, and wet it is turned to that we call water 5 for 
 oyl,though it be foft, liquid, and fluid, yet it is not abfolute wet, 
 it is rather moift then wet : for there is a difference between 
 moift and wet, or glibby and wet, or glibby and moift, fo that 
 oyl is a glibby and moift body, rather then a foaking wet body;

 but when this watry extenuation extenuates beyond the de- 
 gree of water , they turn to vapour, which caufeth 
 the difeafed to be puft or blown like a bladder, rather then 
 fwell’d out, as we fhall perceive that a little time before the 
 patients fall into a confumption, they will be fo puft out, as 
 their llefh wil be like a hre-bal, the next degree they fall into 
 a fiery extenuation 5 For when the humour extenuates be- 
 yond vapor, which is a kinde of anaire, then it becomes hot 
 like fire, which is a hective fevour, and when the humour hath 
 extenuated to the fartheft degree, it expulfes , and fo pulls 
 down and throws out the life of the difeafed; but in the hi- 
 dropical difeafes, there muft firft be applied attractive medi- 
 cines to draw out the watry overflows, by fifties, cupping-glaftes, 
 or the like, then there mult be applyed expullive medicines as 
 purgings, and bleeding, and Iweatings, yet they muft be gent- 
 ly applyed, for fear of weakning the body by drawing out 
 the humour too fuddenly, then there muft be applied con- 
 tracting medicines to draw into an united lubftance, as to ga- 
 ther or draw up thole parts that have been made loofe, porous, 
 and lpungie with the difeafe, then there muft be applied reten- 
 tive medicines, to confirm and fettle them, after their natural 
 manner, or form, then laft there muft be applied difgeftive me- 
 dicines to reftore what is wafted ; but if any of the principal 
 parts be impaired, wafted or expulfed : they neither can be 
 reftored nor mended , but by a new creation, which uncrea- 
 ting braines perhaps conceive not ; but I muft intreat my 
 readers to obferve, that fome forts of motions begin a difeafe, 
 that is, they lay the foundations thereof; and other forts of 
 motions work upon thofe foundations. 
 
 Chap. 193. Of apoplexies. 
 
 S Ome forts of apoplexies are caufed by an inbred fuper- 
 fluous water, in the brain, which being congealed by a 
 cold contra&ion, falling to the knitting part of the hdad,which 
 is the hinder parr, it ftupifies the fenles, flopping the natural 
 motions as a flowing river, that is turned into ice ; but thofe 
 forts of apoplexies are curable, if aftiftance be taken in 
 time, which is by hot dilating medicines, not oncly to ftretch 
 out the icy contraction, but to expell that cold watry 
 humour by a rarification, but if the apoplexic be cau- 
 fed by an inbred {lime , as fiegme, which is of a thicker 
 nature then water, and is become crufted or petera- 
 ted by hot contractions, it is feldom or never cured, no more 
 then brick which is once baked by the fun, or in a fire, can be 
 made to fuch clay as it was before it was burnt ; But mi- 
 ftake me not, for I do not mean the humour is as hard as 
 ftone,or brick in the head, but fo hard, as to the nature of 
 the brain, that is, the fiegme is grown fo dry and tough, as not 
 to be diffolved, fo foon as the nature of the brain requires it,

 for though fiegmc will be contracted into ftone, as in the blad- 
 der, and kidnies, yet not in the brain, by reafon the nature of 
 the brain is fo tender, and fo lenfible, as it cannot indure fo 
 lolid a fubftance therein , nor iuffer fo long a time as the hu- 
 mour will be penetrating to flop the paffages to the brain, not 
 but thofe kinde of motions that produce ftone, may be fo 
 ftrong and fo fvvift as to turn matter into ftone immediately; 
 but I do beleeve not in the animal bodies, for they are too weak 
 figures for fo ftrong motions to work in ; but as I faid thefe 
 hot or cold contractions, tor both torts of contractions pro- 
 duce ftone, fo both forts of contractions make tough, clammy, 
 crufted, hard ftegme, which is tome degree towards ftone, 
 flegme if it ftop the paffages to the brain, ft cauleth an apo- 
 plexie ; but the reafon why the watry contractions are more 
 apt tor cure, is, becaufe the nature of water is fluid, and is 
 eafily dilfolved by dilations, having interior nature to extenua- 
 tions ; but ftime, and flegme are more folid, and fo not fo 
 flexible,to be wrought upon, as fuddenly to change fhape,or na- 
 ture, in being diflolved or transformed. 
 
 The third caufe is a fulnefle of blood, or a thickneffe of 
 blood ; for when the veins are too full, there is not vacuity e- 
 nough for the blood to run, fo ftops the motion thereof, or 
 if the blood is too thick, or clammy, it becoms leffe fiuid,and 
 the more folid it is, the flower the motion is, and though 
 the blood may have too quick a motion by reafon of heat, To 
 it may have too flow a motion by reafon of thickneffe, and if the 
 vetoes are filled too full of hot blood, wherein are many fpiritf, 
 it endangers the breaking tome of the vetoes, like as when ftrong 
 liquor is put into a barrel, if it be filled too ful the ftrength of 
 the fpirks ftriving for liberty, break the barrel; the like will the 
 blood in the veins, and if a vein chance to break to the head, it 
 overflows the brain and drowns the life therein. 
 
 The laft is groffe vapor which may alcend from the bowels, or 
 ftomack, which caufeth fo great a fmoak, as it fuffocates, or 
 choaks the brain, fmothertog out the life of the body. 
 
 All apoplexies are fomewhat of the nature of dead 
 palfies.

 tention 5 which extention {welling out towards the outward 
 part of the head, hinders allrecourfe, {topping tho{e patfages 
 which fhould receive the objects, through the exterior {enfes 3 
 and the froth or {limy humor, which is betwixt the skin, where 
 the brain lies 3 and the skull being prelfed out, fals through 
 the throat into the mouth, and there works forth like yeaft, 
 which is called foaming 3 but though the motions of the head 
 are thus altered for a time, lo as there is neither fenfe nor ra- 
 tional knowledg, yet the body may be after the natural courfe, 
 and not any wayes altered 3 but the body feeling life oppreft 
 in the head, the leveral parts or members in the body, ftrive 
 and ftruggle with what power and ftrength they have to re- 
 lea fe it ; Like as a loyal people that would defend or releafe 
 their natural and true born King, from being prifoner to a fo- 
 raign enemy 5 but when this water flows to the hinder part of 
 the head, the pia mater, and dia mater, extending out that 
 way, flops all the nerves in the nodel of the head, by which 
 flopping, it flops the exterior motions of the whole body, by 
 reafon that place is the knitting place of thofe moving ftringsj 
 and when the water is flow’d, as I faid, to this part, the difealed 
 lies as in a fwoon, as if they were quite dead, having no viflble 
 motion, but as foon as the water begins to fall back, they begin 
 to recover out of the fits 3 but as often as the water in the head 
 is at full tides, either of the fore part of the head, or the hin- 
 der part, the dileafed fals into a fit, which is fometimes oftner 
 then other, for it keeps no conftant courfe, time, nor mealure 5 
 and according as the pia mater and dia mater extends, the fits 
 are {longer or weaker. 
 
 Like wile fuch green water with fuch motions about the 
 heart, may produce the fame difeafe, for oft times this green 
 water , or green thin humor alcends or runs from feveral 
 parts of the body, into the cefierns of the head and the heart 3 
 and this kinde of water or humor, if it be in the nerves, cauleth 
 dangerous convulfions, by reafon of the fharpnefs that ihrivels 
 up the nerves 3 and when it is in the bloud caufes the veins to 
 contra#, through the fame reafon, if in the ftomach, it caufes 
 vomiting, or great fluxes, by fubdividing the humors 3 and the 
 fharpnefs, prickling or tickling the ftomach, provokes a {fram- 
 ing, as tickling in the nole doth freezing 3 fo the ftomach, either 
 to ftrain upwards or downwards.

 Chap. 1 5> < 5 . Of Convulfions , and Cramps. 
 
 C Onvulfions proceed from contrary contracting motions, 
 quire irom the natural motions of the body, as winding 
 up the iinews, nerves, or veins ; but efpecially thofe finews, 
 which joyn,and impair the muicles together, drawing not onely 
 contrary, but contracting feveral wayes, and after divers man- 
 ners ; tor tome time the nerves are as if we fhould tie 
 it rings in bowt-knots , others as if we fhould winde up 
 Lute ftrings on pegs ; and tome are twitted like whip-cord, and 
 many the like wayes, which would be too long to recount, but 
 thefe contractions proceed either from a winde got into the 
 nerves, or veines, which troubles them as the wihde-cholick 
 doth the guts, or a fharp humor that fhrivels them together, 
 or as fait watery humor, mixt with winde, which ftrugling and 
 itriving together turns windes, folds, or roles up the nerves, 
 like the waves of the Sea, or a cold icy humor, which draws 
 and gathers in the nerves, as froft will do, all lpungie bodies, 
 or lome thick clammy humor which flops fome paffages, which 
 caufeth the natural motions to turn irregular, but if the humor 
 be onely in the veins, it is cured by letting bloud, if the bloud 
 be corrupted, fharp or fait, or if the bloud be cold, windy, or 
 watry, hot liquid medicines cure it, or cordial water, or the 
 like ; and if it be a cold humor in the nerves, hotoyls, and ex- 
 traordinary hot medicines cures it, as the fpirit of Cafter, oyl 
 of Amber, and the like $ but it it proceed from a fait, fharp, 
 watery humor, or a thick clammy humor in the nerves, it is 
 feldom or never cured, becaufe it is not eafily got out, neither 
 can medicines fo fuddenly get into the nerves, as into the veins; 
 for though the cold in the nerves may be eafily cured, by melt- 
 ing, and dilfolving by the comfortable warmth, or violent 
 heats from the hot cordial medicines, which fpread about the 
 body, as a great fire in a chimney, which lpreads about and 
 heats all the room, if the fire in the chimney be anfwerable to 
 the bignefs, or largenefs of the room it is in, and the leffer the 
 room is, and the bigger the fire is, the hotter it is ; wherefore 
 it is to be confidered, that thofe that are at full growth, or are 
 larger of body, if thus, the difeafed ought to have a greater 
 proportion, or a larger quantity of thofe medicines, then a 
 childe, or thofe that are but little of ftature, for though thofe 
 that are of little ftature may be more ftronger then thofe that 
 are of a far bigger bulk, yet in the caufe of diffufing or dilating 
 medicines, the circumference of the body muft be confidered, 
 as well as the ftrength of the medicines ; and if the convulfion 
 be in the ftomach, caufed by the aforefaid humor ; purging 
 medicines or cordials may cure it, unlefs the ftomach is ga- 
 thered, fhriveH’d, or fhrunk up by an unnatural contracting

 ftomach can no more be cured then leather to be made fmooth, 
 which is fhrunk up in a purfe,by fire^after the like manner as cor.- 
 vulfions or cramps, but cramps moft commonly are only contra- 
 ctions of the fmal veins, w ch tie or twill them up, 6 z many times 
 fo hard as they break ; for thofe that have been much troubled 
 with the cramp, wil have all the skin,where the cramp hath taken 
 them all ftretch’d with broken veinsjl mean the fmall hair veins, 
 but rubbing the part grieved with a warm cloath, will untie and 
 untwift them again, by diffolving the cold, or dilperfing the 
 winde, or rarifying the bloud therein, this we finde by experi- 
 ence j wherefore I fhould think that in convulfion fits, that are 
 caufed by the like, that if the difeafed fhould be rubbed with 
 hot cloaths, outwardly applied, as well as hot medicines inward- 
 ly taken, it may do the patient much good. But I muft remem- 
 ber my Readers, that in Convulfions, the flrength of the medi- 
 cines inwardly taken, muft be according to the flrength of the 
 fits ; for if they be ftrong fits, weak medicines do no good j for 
 more flrength goeth to untie a hard knot, then a loofe knot,or to 
 untwift a hard firing, then a loofe firing j befides, it is hard to 
 know after what manner the knot is tied or twilled, and many 
 indeed are fo ignorant of medicines, as the manner of the difeafe, 
 to apply fuch as fhall hap of the right end, as thofe which 
 are cured by chance, and chance hits fo feldom right , as not 
 one of an hundred efcapes of thefe kinde of difeafes, if the 
 difeafe is any wayes violent, for then the motions tie fo fall, and 
 fo ftrong, as they break the life of that figure afunder. There be 
 natural contractions, and unnatural contractions 5 that is, proper 
 or improper to the health of the figure.

 A LL Collicks are towards the nature of Convulfions, or at

 Some Collicks proceed from raw undigefted humors. 
 
 Some from fharp melancolly humors.

 but thofe Collicks are Cramps^ but the caufe of all Collicks 
 are by extenuating motions, though the effects are oft times 
 contracting, but if the caufe be contracting, it is a Cramp, 
 not a Collick, for a Collick is properly winde, produced from Cramps oft 
 the aforefaid humors ; that is, when thofe humors extenuate ^cdLks,

 ting motions thrufting outward and the refitting motions thruft- 
 ing backward, run crols, or beat on each other, which caufeth 
 pain ; and as long as the ftrife lafts, the body hath no eafe, un- 
 til fome alfiftance in medicines be given, or that it can over- 
 matter the reilftent motions j but when once it hath liberty, it 
 flies out in expulfive motions, at all vents j but if the extenua- 
 ting humors are broke, or dilfolved in the body, by the well 
 tempered motion therein, or expulfing of its fell, it evaporates 
 through the pores of the body in infenlible tranfpirations 5 but 
 if the extenuating can finde no way to be expuifed, it gathers 
 inward in fmall, and fmaller rings, like a fcrue drawing in the 
 guts or ftomach, therein flopping the paffages thereof, whereby 
 the body can neither receive nourifhment, nor fend out excre- 
 ment, with which the body is brought to an utter deftruClion 5 
 but thefe kinds of windes caufing this diftember, this diftemper 
 is oft times produced from fharp, hot, cholerick humors ; which 
 fharpnefs hath a natural contracting quality which is rather of 
 the nature of a cramp, or a convulfion, then the nature of a 
 collick ; howfoever expulfive medicines are good in thefe cafes 
 of difeafes. Convulfions are collicks in the nerves, and cramps 
 collicks in the veins 5 and as the collick in the ftomach or guts 
 proceeds fometimes from windc, and fometimes from crude- 
 bilious fharp humors, fo doth this.

 D ifeafes and fwimming, which are difeafes, belonging onely

 onely to the head, yet the motions and humors of the ftomach 
 have greater affinity to the head, and many times caufe the di- 
 feafes therein, by the courle and recourfe thereto and there- 
 from ; for fome humors falling from the head into the fto- 
 mach, do fo difaffeCt that part, as it returns more malignity 
 up again, and fometimes the ftomach begins the war, fend- 
 ing up fuch an army of ill vapors, as many times they do not 
 onely diforder the head, but totally ruinate it 5 but moft com- 
 monly the vapors which attend to the head, are gathered 
 by contracting motions, into clouds, as vapor is which ariftth 
 from the earth, and as long as the vapor is in a cloudy body, it 
 makes that part feel heavy, and the ienfes dull by obstructions, 
 for it flops the nofe, dims the fight, fills the ears, blunts the 
 tafte, and numbs the touch ; efpecially if the obftruCtion be 
 caufed from a cold contraction, which congeals the vapor to an 
 icy fubftance, but when it is expuifed, by a hot dilation, it falls 
 down like hail or flakes of fnow, by which, I mean, cold glaffie

 that it they fhould la ft too long, they may caufe numb palfies; 
 or the like, and if contracted, fo as one may fay chriftalined 
 it may caufe an incurable dead palfie, but if it be difperft by a 
 hot expulfion, it is diftblved in thundring coughs, or falls 
 like pouring fhoures of* rain, running through the fpouts of the 
 noile, eyes, and mouth, and through the pores of the skin, and 
 fometimes falls into the cabberns or bowels of the body, as the 
 ftomack, and the intrals ; but if fome of the floud-gats chance 
 to be ftopped by obftructions,thefe fhoures may chance to over- 
 flow the body, and make an utter deftruCtion, otherwife it one- 
 ly wafhes and clenfes thefe parts ; but if vapor be gathered 
 by a hot contraction , they become lharp and fait, 
 as being of a burning quality, and if they be difperft by 
 a hot expulfion, they fall down like a milling rain, which hath 
 a foaking and penetrating faculty, cutting and piercing thofe 
 parts they fall on by inlenfible degrees, which rots the vital 
 parts, not onely by the fharpneflfe which ulcerates, but by a

 not equally or harmonioully ; as for example, fay there were

trebles for the tenor, and bafcs, or too many tenors for the tre- 
 bles and bafes, and too many bafes for the tenors and trebles 
 to make a harmony ; So in the body there may be too much 
 of one, or more kinde of motions lor other kindes to make 
 a harmony of health, as lor proof; too many contracting mo- 
 tions, make the body too dry, and contract difeafes ; as for 
 example, inftead of binding any thing, we Ihould break it by 
 pulling or drawing too hard together, or inftead of joyning of 
 parts, we (hould knock them lo clofe as to rivet, or iplit them; 
 or inftead of gathering fuch a quantity of matter, or joyning 
 fuch a number of parts, we Ihould gather twice or thrice the 
 quantity; or numbers ol the like examples might be given; for 
 ail other kinde of motions, as dilating or expulftve, inftead 
 of throwing out the fuperfluities, or rubbifh inahoufe, we 
 Ihould pull down the houle, and difperfe the materials therein, 
 digging up the foundation thereof. 
 
 Likewife too many dilating, or expulftve motions, may dil- 
 perfe, or divide parts, or unl'ettle, or unground parts : which 
 difunites weaknes, and diftolves parts or bodies. 
 
 Wherefore all contracting, attracting, retentive, difgeftive, 
 dilating, expulftve motions in a well tempered body, mult 
 move like the fcveral Planets, every fort in their proper lphears, 
 keeping their times, motions, tempers, and degrees; but too 
 many or too ftrong contracting motions, caufe the gout, ftone, 
 plurifte, heCtive fevers, numb and dead palfies, dry-liver, brain, 
 and many the like ; and too many dilating motions, caufe 
 dropftes, winde-colicks, rhumes, fhaking palftes , fweats, or 
 fainting ftcknes,&milions, the like, and too many, or too ftrong 
 expulftve motions, caule fluxes, vomiting, bleeding, and the 
 like, and too many , or too ftrong digeftive motions, caule too 
 much blood, fat, and ftefh, which is apt to choak the vital 
 parts, or may nourifh fome particular parts, lo much as may 
 make them grow, and fwell out fo bigg, as they may be dit 
 proportionable, for the reft* ol the parts in the body. 
 
 But ftill I mull remember my readers; that all dilating mo- 
 tions, are in the way of expulfton ; and all attractions in the 
 way of contraction, and digeftion, are mixt motions taking 
 part from either fide, then Imuft remember my readers, 
 that there are infinite wayes or manners of contractions, and 
 infinite wayes, or manners of wayes of attraction, and fo of re- 
 tentions, dilations, expulfions, and difgeftions, where every

 health, making feveral figures, and changes with the feet of

 tion perturbed ; and irregular, keeping neither time nor mea-

 Chap. 202. The nature of purging medicines . 
 
 M O ft purging drugs are of the nature of hot burning fire;. 
 
 for the inherent motions therein work according to the 
 humour, or matter it meets with, fome humor they melt, 
 making it thin and fluid, although it be hard, tough or clam- 
 my, and as fire doth oare which is unmelted metal, makes it 
 fo fluid,as it will run through a gutter of earth like water ; 
 fo do fome drugs make fome forts of humour through the 
 body, either upward or downward. 
 
 Again, fome drugs will work upon fome humours, as fire 
 upcTn wood, dividing the humour into fmall parts, as afhes 
 from wood, which naturally falls downward. 
 
 And fome they will diifolve by mouldring, and crumbling, 
 as fire doth ftone, which runs forth like {and, which is ftone in- 
 deed bred in the body. 
 
 Some drugs rarifie the humors into wind, as fire willrari- 
 fie, and evaporate water, which is fet boyling theron. 
 
 Other drugs will at fire that diftiis out the moift, 
 and watry fubftance, from that which is more grofie; 
 but it is to be obferved, that all purging drugs that work 
 by vomit, are fomewhat of the nature of that kinde of fire 
 we call fuiphur ; or oyl that is melted, or fluid fulphur,

I have treated 
 of the feveral 
 forts of fire. 
 
 (158) 
 
 when thefe forts of drugs are fet on fire, as I may fay, by 
 the natural or diftempered heat in the body, it flies out af- 
 cendingly, like JEma-, for it is of the nature of fulphur to af- 
 cend as flame doth 3 . and certainly al bodies have fuch motions 
 naturally inherent in them, as make and produce fuch effects 
 as fire doth on feveral forts of humours, by which motions 
 the body hath a natural cleanfing faculty, which makes the na- 
 tural purging quality • but when the motions are fo violent, 
 they oftentimes deftroy the body with burning fevers, or vio- 
 lent fluxes, or the like 3 for the fire in the body, is like a fire 
 in a chimnie, for when the chimny is clean, and the fire pro- 
 portionable to lie therein, it warms and comforts all a- 
 bout , and is ufeful for many imployments for the neceffaries 
 of life 3 but if the chimny be foul, or the fire too big, or too 
 much for the chimny, it lets all in a flame, confuming whatfo- 
 ever it incompaffes, if it be not quenched out with cooling ju- 
 lips, as with water, or by calling on rubbifh, or groffe materi- 
 als to fmother it out, as in great fluxes, they will not onely 
 give reftringent medicines, as having a natural reftringent fa- 
 culty, but thick meats, as thicked milk, or the like 3 but when 
 the body is reftringent, or hath taken reftringent medicines, 
 it is produced by drying motions, as contracting, or retentive 
 motion, if they be hot, retentive, or contracting motions, they 
 they harden and confirm the humours, as the heat of the fun, 
 or the heat of the fire doth clay, which turns it to brick or tile, 
 or thofe things we call earthen pots, and according as the hu- 
 mour is groffe or fine, the more bride or hard, or thick 
 or heavie, or thinne or light 3 It is for fome humor as 
 Profelnye, or Chyney, others as the groftc-r earthen veffels ; 
 Again, home forts of contracting, or retentive motions draw 
 the humour, as when bacon, neats tongues, or the like, are 
 dryed in a chimney, or oven, or the like 3 other forts of hot 
 contractions draw the humour, as the fun doth the earth, dry- 
 ing up the watry fpring therein 3 but if the reftringencies either 
 of the body, or of the medicines be caufed by cold retentive 
 or contracting motions, it dries the humors, as cold 
 froft dries the earth, or bindes up the humors, as froft: binds 
 up the waters in icy fetters, or thickens the humors, as £old 
 thickens the water, or vapor drawn from the earth into clouds 
 of fnow. But I am to advertife my readers, that all expulfive 
 motions are not fiery expulfions 3 for there are infinite ieveral 
 wayes of expulfive motions, and dilations. 
 
 Secondly thefe fiery motions do not alwayes work expul- 
 fively, but contract ively, attractively, and retentively, and dif- 
 geftively. 
 
 Thirdly, all expulfive, dilative, difgeftive, contraCtive, attra- 
 ctive, retentive motions are not fiery, but there is fuch a kinde, 
 or fort of contractions, attractions, retentions difgeftions, di- 
 lations, and expulfions, as belong to fire or heat, or as I may 
 
 better

 better fay, produces heat or fire, and as I faid there are in- 
 finite feveral wayes of each kinde of motion 5 as for example, 
 I will treat of one of them: a bee gather wax, a bird gather 
 ft raws, and a man gathers flicks 5 the bees gather and carie 
 the wax to the hive to make a comb, to lay, or hold and keep 
 the honey ; the bird gathers and carries the draw to build a 
 neft to hatch her young ones kg the man gathers wood to 
 mend his houfe, thefe all gather to one end, but yet feveral 
 wayes; for the bees gather the wax, and carie it on their thighs, 
 the bird gathers the ftraw, and carries it with their bill , the 
 man gathers with his hands, but carries it feveral wayes, as on 
 his head, or on his fhoulders, or at his back, or in his armes, 
 and milions of the like examples may be given upon each 
 kinde or fort of motion, or moved matter. 
 
 Again, I muft advercife my readers, that though I fay there 
 are fiery motions in drugs, and natural fiery motions in every 
 animal creature, and fo in many other figures ; yet I mean 
 not a bright fhining fire, although fome are of opinion, that in 
 the heart is a thin tiame, and when that is put out, or goeth 
 out, the creature dies ; but I mean not fuch a fire, for to my 
 apprehenfion there' are three forts.of fire to our perceivance, al- 
 though there may be numberleffe forts, yet all of one kinde : as 
 for example, there are thofe creatures we call animals, though 
 fome are beafts, birds, fifh, and men, but not onely fo, for 
 fome are of one fort, and fome of another ; for a lennit is not a 
 parot, nor a parot an owl ; nor a horfe a cow, nor a fheep a 
 dog , nor a whale a herring, nor a herring a plaife, nor a plaife 
 a lobfter ; nor a black-more is not a tauny-more, nor a Euro- 
 pian an Ethiopian, yet all are of animal kinde ; fo although 
 there may be feveral forts of fire, and fo of the other elements, 
 yet all are of the fiery kinde,or likewife the fiery motions make 
 feveral figures, and feveral figures have feveral fiery motions, 
 for every fort of animals have a feveral fhape, and feveral mo- 
 tions belonging to that fhape ^ fo in fiery figures, and fiery 
 motions; but as I faid before; there are three forts of fire. The 
 firft is a bright- fhining hot-burning fire, that is, when the interi- 
 or, and exterior temperament of matter, and the interior and 
 exterior figure, and the interior and exterior motions be all as 
 one. The fecond is a hot-burning fire, but not a bright fhi- 
 ning fire,fuch as Aqua-fortis, vitrals, and fuch forts of the fame 
 nature which will burn as fire doth, but not thin as the other 
 fire doth ; for though they are both of an interior nature, yet 
 not of an exterior, for the bright-fhining fire is all compofed 
 of fharp points, as 1 may fay, lines of points, but this vitral fire 
 is as iharp edged lines, like a rafor,or knife, or the like, nei- 
 ther is there external motions alike ; for bright-fhining fire 
 mounts upwards, when it is not fuppreft, or in a ftraight para- 
 lel line, for flame which is the liquid part of bright-fhining

 lines they afcend in are a ftraight diameter line, but this vi- 
 tral fire defcends as it were downward, or divides as ftreames 
 of water do, that digs it left a paftage through the earth, lo this 
 vitral cuts a paftage, through what it works on, neither can this 
 lore of fire work lo varioully, as bright-fhining fire can, by rea- 
 fon it hath not fo many parts, for points will fall into more 
 parts, and are more Iwift in motion, then the edged line; as for 
 example, duft which is numerous little parts heapt together, 
 will be more agile upon the leaft motion, although it be of a 
 weighty nature, as of the nature of a ftone. 
 
 The final haires which be of a light, and weightleffe nature, 
 but being not divided into fo many parts, cannot move lo nim- 
 ble, as being united lines, but if you cut the hair into final 
 parts, it fhail move with more reftleffe motion, then the fand, 
 by fo much the more as the fubftance is lighter. 
 
 The third fort of fire is that which I call a cold dull fire, 
 fuch as brimftone, or fulphur, mercury, fait, oyl, or the like, 
 this fort in the interior nature is of the nature of bright-fhining 
 fire, both in the motions, and temperaments of matter, but 
 not in the exterior, for it is compofed of points, but thofe points 
 are turned inward, as toward the Center : but affoon 
 as it touches the bright-fhining fire, it ftraight turns the 
 points outward : for thole points foon catch hold of thofe 
 ftraight circumferent lih&, and break them in funder, 
 which as loon as they are broke, the points are at liberty, 
 and taking their freedom, they mount in a flame ; but when 
 thofe lines are not difl'olved by fire, but crack, as we will fnap 
 a firing afunder , then they oncly Iparkle fire out, but not flame 
 out; but mercury, or quick-lil ver, the interior is fire, but the 
 exterior is water, for the exterior moves extenuating circles as 
 water doth, and fo much as to make it foft, and fluid, but 
 not fo much as to make it wet; for though it alwayes gathers 
 into fphiratical figures, which {hews that the exterior would 
 run into wet, but that the interior hinder it, by drawing the 
 circles inward, as cold doth water into hail-ftones, but yet the 
 interior wants the force to make it fo hard and firm ; but as I 
 did advertile my Readers before, that all forts of fire work ac- 
 cording to the matter it meets with, yet none work fo vari- 
 oufly, as the bright-fhining fire; which makes me think that 
 drugs are more of the nature of bright-fhining fire, then of the 
 two other forts, becaufe they work in the body according to 
 the humour it meets with , for if it meets wit watrifh humors, 
 itboylsitas water in a pot, which either boiles over the 
 mouth of the ftomack, or evaporates out in fweat, like 
 dewes, or draws downward, like as in fhowe rs ofrain,it melts 
 humors like metrh or turns humors like wood into allies, or 
 calcines the humor, where fome part is fixed, other parts arc 
 volable ; As for example, Rubarb hath a double faculty, fome 
 humors it expels out, others it bindes up ; for Rubarb is both

 more lolid fub fiance, fo as it, Moth expulfe and contra# at one

 with 3 Again, lbme drugs move feveral expulfive wayes, as by 
 vomit and ftool, where the vomiting is produced with af- 
 cending expulfions, fiege with defcending expulfions, but that 
 expulles defcending are of the nature of vitral fire, all that ex- 
 pulles afcendingly, is of the nature of fulphurous fire3 but the 
 generality of drugs works like bright-fhming fire, according to 
 the nature of the matter, it meets with, as I have formerly 
 defcribed. 
 
 C hap. 103. The motion- of Medicines » 
 
 A S I have laid in my former chapter, that all medicinal 
 drugs, or fimples, efpecially thole that purge, are of the 
 nature of fire 3 for the motions therein moft commonly 
 work apart according to the humor it meets with, as fire 
 doth, which in general is to move fo and fo *3 yet the natural 
 motions in drugs, and likewife in fire are expulfive, and all 
 that is expulfive, is by antipathetical nature ftriving to deftroy 
 by uniting parts, and all contractive motions are byalympa- 
 thetical nature, ftriving to unite, by imbracing, or drawing 
 parts together, yet the nature of the body they work in the 
 contracting motions, may be antipathetical, and expulfive mo- 
 tions may be fympathetical, the one in expelling the fuperfluous 
 and corrupted humors, the other in contracting them into a dif- 
 eafc,but moft dileafes are cured by contrary motions'/or if they 
 be difeafes of expulfions, they mull be cured by contracting, or 
 retentive medicines3if they be dileafes of contraCtions,they mull 
 be cured by expulfive medicines, or elfe dilating or attracting^ 
 for though the motions of attraction be agreeable, or of the 
 nature of contraction, as to its felf, as I may fay, that is, to 
 draw or carry, all to a center, as it were, but the onely diffe- 
 rence is, that attraction make it felf the center, drawing all 
 things to it 3 but contractions make the matter they work 
 on , part of the center with them, but all attractions are in- 
 finuating motions, inviting, or drawing all towards it felf, or 
 like a man that lhould draw a difh of meat, or as if one fhould 
 fuck the brefts or udder, but contracting motions are rather to 
 binde,or knit up parts together, but if the difeales proceed from 
 difuniting motions, then retentive medicines muft be applied, 
 which is to firm, hold, or fettle parts that are loofe, unfteddy^ 
 but if the dileafes proceed out of dilorder and irregularity, they 
 muft be cured by digeftive medicines, which is put every 
 part in order, and in its proper place 3 like wife States-men

 obfervedi that every degree in the difeaie muft be followed 
 with the fame degree in the medicine, whether fwift or flow, 
 ftrong or weak, or more, or leffe, that is, you match your medi- 
 cines to the dileale; but miftake me not, I mean not after the 
 literal fenfejbut after the metaphorical fenfe;but al purging me- 
 dicines are dilative of expul(ive,all reftringent medicines, are 
 contradive, and retentive. 
 
 All drawing medicines are attra6tive. 
 
 All reftorative, or reviving medicines are difgcftive. 
 
 And thole contracting medicines that muft cure the bo- 
 dy, mud fympathize with the natural health, and conftitution 
 oithe body, not with the dileafe, for thefe motions, draw, 
 gather, or at leaft knit , and bind up the found parts from the 
 corrupted parts, left tr ey fhould intermix, and retentive re- 
 medies do not onely flay thole parts that are apt to dilunite, 
 but give ftrength, and hold out the a (faulting motions in 
 miftempered matter, and all attradive medicines that fym- 
 pathize with the natural honftitutions of the body, lucks and 
 draws forth from the cofrupt matter the pure, which is mix- 
 ed, or inuolved therein; but thofe attradive, and drawing 
 medicines that are applied to outward (ores, or the like, muft 
 have a fympathy with the malady, or putrifadion, for all a- 
 verfions do caft outward; or from them, not draw to 
 them. 
 
 As for the expulfive remedies they muft be carefully ap- 
 plied, left they fhould caft forth the wrong humor, by which 
 the * malignant grows more powerful, or elfe fhould carry 
 out more humor, then the ftrength ol the body , will permit, 
 or fhould be (o weak, or of fuch a nature, onely to difturb, and 
 unlettle, but hot carry forth , from which difturbance great 
 inconveniences, or deadly quarels in the body may arife ; 
 wherefore thefe medicines are more dangerous then any ci- 
 ther fort, although no medicine can be lately applied, unlefle 
 the ftrength and nature be anlwerable to the conftitution of 
 the body, or the difeafes in the body, no not thofe we 
 call reftorative, or reviving remedies, which work difgeftive- 
 ly, fuch as cordials, or the like, for when there is more ap- 
 plied then will fagree with the conftitution of the body, or 
 with the temper, or degree of the difeafes, they turn from be- 
 ing aflifting friends, to affaulting enemies, for when they have 
 more force then regular work, they put in diforder thofe re- 
 gularities, for want of regular imployment ; for it is againft 
 the nature of innate matter to defift from moving, or work- 
 ing, but it is not againft nature to change and alter the 
 motions.

 S ome times the humours of the body, and the outward 
 fenfes agree and difagree ; fometimes the humours of the 
 body, and the paflions of the minde, agree, or difagree; 
 fometimes the paflions of the minde, and the outward fen- 
 fes agree, or dilagree, and fometimes the fenfes, and thepaf- 
 fions dilagree, or agree with the humors of the body. 
 
 As for example, iometimes the diftempered humors in the 
 body, make extravagancy in the fenles, as we fee in fevers; 
 and Iometimes the diftempered humors of the body make a 
 dilordered minde, as we fee thofe that have cholerick hu- 
 mors,cholerick paflions; melancholy humours, melancholy paf- 
 lions, and the like, or diftempered humors, extravagant imagi- 
 nations, and the like. 
 
 Sometimes extravagant fenfes make extravagant fancies, 
 fometimes a fuperabundant humor makes a ftrong particular 
 appetite; as for example, thofe in the* green ficknefle, the 
 overflowing, or increale of fome raw, and indigefted humor 
 will caule a ftrong particular appetite, as fome in that difeafe 
 love to fmell ftrong fmells, as camfier, tanned-leather, mufty 
 bottles, or. the like, or to delight onely in one tafte, as oate- 
 meal, coals, or feveral particular rafts, or extravagant tafts, 
 not natural to the conftitution of the body, as to delight to 
 eat coals, leather, candles, cork, and milions of the like; and 
 the humour increafeuh, and is nourifhed by the fympathy of 
 that extravagant diet ; for what the fenfes take pleafure in, 
 the minde longs for. Again, lome humors Antipathizc, as to 
 hate all loathfome tafts, fmells, noices, touches, and ob- 
 jects. 
 
 So paftions fympathize with fome humors, and difagree with 
 others, for fome bitter humors make cholerick paflions, fharp 
 humors make fpitelul paflions, tough humors make a dull un- 
 derftanding, melancholy humors, make timerofity, cholerick 
 humors jnake courage, and many the like; then the fenfes of 
 the minde agree , and difagree often, as fome objects will 
 aftonifh the lenfes, and ravifh the minde, delight the fenfe, 
 and caufe love in the minde ; others which the fenfe dillike, 
 caufeth hate in the minde, pain in the fenfe, grieving in the 
 minde, plealure inthelenle, delight in the minde ; but if the 
 fettle and minde difagree, then the fenfe likes that the minde 
 hates; As for example, the fenfe is taking pleafure upon an 
 objedf which for the crofle difpolition, the minde ha r es, or for

fome jnjury done, or by fome negled, or out ofenvie, and as 
 they fympathize,and antipathize in their working, and makings 
 (o in the expulfions, timeworks out a paflion, accidents work 
 out paflion, evacuations work out paflion; the like in the fen- 
 fes, io many times humors are expulfed by paflions, and as the 
 fuperfluities are purged out of the body,after the lame manner, 
 are violent paflions trom the minde ; for as the body purges 
 by fiege, by vomit, by urin, by (pitting, by fweating, by blee- 
 ding, by inciflons, and the like; lo ftrong paflions are purged 
 by weeping, by Sighing, groaning, (peaking, and ading ; but 
 if the increaflng motions of the humors in the body, and the 
 paflions in the minde, be as many, and as ftrong, as the expul- 
 sive motions, then there is a continuance of the lame humour 
 or paflion, for whatfoever is caft forth, or wafted, is bred 
 again. 
 
 C hap, 205. Of outward objefts dif agreeing with the natural 
 motions , and humours in the body. 
 
 I N ward commotions of the body are oftentimes caufed by 
 outward objects, or (ubjeds, as when the feufes take ade- 
 light at fome kinde of found, feent, fight ,tafte, and touch ; as for 
 example, fome will (ownd at a fearful noife,that is, at a fudden, 
 or unacuftomed, or tumultuous noife ; others will fownd at the 
 fight of bloud, or at afly cruel objed, or at the fight of a cat, 
 or many other creatures ; fome, will (ownd at fweet-fmels ; o- 
 thers if they fhould tafte cheefe, or any meat they diflike natu- 
 rally, and (ome will not oncly (ownd but die laughing with 
 tickling, the reafon is, that the exterior motion anticipates with 
 the natural motions belonging to the body, (ometimes onely 
 to the fenlitive parts, other-lome to the rational part, others to 
 both. 
 
 The reafon is, that the difordered motions of the outward 
 fenfes, diforderthe interior motions, which makes the body 
 (ick, and the body paflionate, and fometimes the brain fran- 
 tick, and if they make not the body fick, nor the brain mad; 
 yet thofe antipathetical, and thefe difordered motions, never fail 
 to put the fenlc to pain, or move paflion ; but when thefe anti- 
 pathetical motions be too ftrong for the natural motions belong- 
 ing to the body, or minde, it brings death, or unrecoverable 
 madnes, for then the natural motions belonging to that body, 
 is as it were extinguiftied ; thus we may fee that the outward 
 fenfes may be perfed, and the inward parts within that body 
 may be corrupt and decayed ; folikewife the outward fenfes 
 may be defeded , and the inward parts found, and fo fome 
 parts of the body firme, and others infirme, and fome of the 
 outward parts, or fenfe wanting, or defedive, others free clear 
 and diftinguifhing. 
 
 The reafon is,that fome of the fenfitive innated matter works 
 
 orderly, 
 


## p. 165 (#191) ############################################

orderly, others diforderly, and clear from the nature of the 
 body ; for as I have faid before,fome of the "exterior parts of 
 the body, may be nummed,or dead;the reafon is that the natural 
 motions, belonging to fiich a part of the body are altered, for 
 every part or parcel, hath proper motions belonging there- 
 unto. 
 
 But if in any part of the body , the natural motions dnely 
 work irregularly, then it onely caufeth a pain in that part; but 
 if the motions work croffe to the nature of the body, it caufeth 
 that part to die, but if they alter but in part, it caufeth onely 
 a numnefle which is in a degree of being dead, but if the na- 
 tural motions be onely ftopt by fome outward accident, or 
 actions, as by a fudden fright, which caufeth the body to fwoon 
 by reafon the fpirits are contracted by the fright into fo ftraight 
 a compaffe, and thronged fo clofe together, that they cannot 
 move in order, or by the aCdon of lying, or prefling too hard, 
 or too heavy upon any part that hinders the fpirits therein 
 from moving after their natural manner, which caufeth a flee- 
 pinefle or numnefle in thofe parts, that are preft by weight, 
 or ftrength; thofe diforders are foonto be rectified. Again, 
 as by giving liberty , or helping the fpirits with cordials 
 which gives ftrength to them, and fets them at liber- 
 ty; but if the fen fitive parts be quite altered from their na* 
 tural . courfe, they feldom are rectified ; But fomedmes the 
 afliftance of the regular motions in the body, joyning as 
 it were with one content, do expel that innated matter out of 
 that part wherein they work, contrary to the nature of the 
 body, and fupplies that part with frefh, and new matter, that 
 moves as itihoulddo. 
 
 Likewife as the fenfitive innated matter works in fome parts 
 of the body irregularly, and in other parts regularly, and in one, 
 and the fame part, fomedmes regularly, and fomedmes irre- 
 gularly,the fame is it many times with the rational innate mat- 
 ter; for fometimes that will moves regularly, and fpmetimes 
 iregularly, that makes frantick men, fometimes to be in their 
 wits, and fometimes out of their wits : but if their madnefle 
 be at certain times, as at full of the moon, or high tides, or 
 fprings, or falls, or in the midft of fummer, or when they 
 keep an evil, or too full a diet, then it proceeds from thofe out- 
 ward accidents, which give afliftance to the difordered motions, 
 which inhabit in the body, the original defeCt being amongft 
 the fenfitive innate matter, for this fhewes that the madnefs 
 proceeds from fome diftemper of thie body, which moft com- 
 monly is in the fpleen, or that which they call in women, the 
 mother, from which parts arife grqfle, and noifom vapors, 
 which afcendsup into the head, and difaffeCts the brain,; and 
 many times the brain is difaffeCted with its own difteiiipers,and 
 whenfoever the brain is diftempcred, the rational innate matter 
 which moves therein, moves irregularly ; but when thofe times

or feafons are paft, or that overfulneffe of humour is purged 
 out, the natural motions of humour get ftrength, and the man 
 is well untili the return thereof. 
 
 : But if the irregularity be in the rational innate matter, it is 
 moft dangerous, for it feldom, or never is cured, nor feldom 
 have intermitting fits, but as a continual fever, in the body, 
 fo is a continual madneffe in the minde. 
 
 But I fhall fpeak more of this in my following chap- 
 ters. 
 
 Chap. 20 6. Of the inward fenfe, and outward fenfe 3 as the 
 interior and exterior parts. 
 
 j^Ome of the exterior fenfes may be extinguifhed, as fight, 
 Shearing, feent, ortafte, orfome parts of the body numb, 
 or dead, or fome disjoynted from the reft; as leggs, or arms, 
 toes, breft j eyes, nofe, or the like, and yet the material parts 
 found and whole, which materal parts are the vital parts, as 
 the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the lights, the fpleen, 
 the maw 3 the midriff, the kidnies, the bladder, or the like ; as 
 for the heart, and the brain, there is fuch a fympathifing, and 
 conjunction with the whole body, as the lead diftemper indan- 
 gers the body,and the leaft alteration of their fhapes,or figures, 
 it deftroyes the life of the body, but for the reft of thole vi- 
 tals, or fundamental parts, when they decay, or are any way 
 jlmpaired, the life doth fink down as in were by degrees, 
 according as thole parts impaires; but if they be wounded, 
 or corrupted by pbiions, or plaguie infections, or by an abfo- 
 lute, and fudden alteration , from their natural motions or 
 figures, then the life is luddenly extinguilhed, but the external 
 figures of the reft of the parts have not fuch a fympathy to the 
 interior motions of the whole figure ; but when I fay the ex- 
 terior figure of the interior parts, I mean the particular figure 
 ,of every particular part, not onely the outward part, as hands 
 and armes, leggs, and head, and body and the like; but of brain, 
 and heart, and liver, and fo all the reft; for though they be 
 internal figures, tothe. external figures, yet they be the exter- 
 nal figures to the internal motion that works in them.

 fharp, fuch as we call fbrill notes, it doth not onely defturb the 
 natural motion in the brain, but many times breaks that skin, or

 veral thoughts, and move the adions accordingly, fo others dif-

 ftrains on the tenor, and bafs, is as commending, extorting, exci - 
 ting, threatning, terrifying, judging, which moves the minde to

 repenting, praying, and vowing, which caufeth an humble fub- 
 miflion, dejected countenance, weeping eys,heaved up hands, and

## p. 168 (#194) ############################################

And flow foft notes, onely on the tenors, are a fad relation, 
 forrowful laments, mournful complaints, pleadings, petitioning, 
 acknowledging faults, begging pardon, imploring mercy, which 
 moves the minde to a tender pitty and companion, and a chari- 
 table love, from whence proceeds a liftning ear, a helping 
 hand, a ferrous countenance, a lad eye, with a favouring call 
 therefrom. 
 
 High, hard, fharp, notes or ftraines, on the balfe or tenor, is 
 like exclaiming, incouraging, or animating, extolling, promi- 
 ling ; which moves the minde to pride, ambition, vain-glory, 
 deiire, hope, which makes the body a&ive, the a&ions adven- 
 trous, bold, the eyes darting and quick. 
 
 Low, fharp ftraines, and crofs notes, and unequal times,move 
 the minde to murmur words, choler, hate, revenge, fury,defpair, 
 the curling, their hands tearing, the legs ftamping, their bodies 
 turning leveral wayes, their countenance maskerd and gaftly, 
 and the eyes Haring. 
 
 But quick fharp ftraines in tenor notes, and foft flow ftrains 
 on treble notes, are as perfwading, flattering, infinuating, pro- 
 fefling, inviting, alluring, this moves the minde to love, the 
 thoughts to be amorous ; this makes their actions affedtive, kil- 
 ling their hands, making of leggs, mending their garments, of- 
 fering their fervice, their words complemental, their counte- 
 nance fmiling, and their eyes glancing. 
 
 And quick fharp ftrains, on the tenor, and treble notes, 
 produce a cheerful minde, it makes the thoughts lively, the 
 countenance pleafant, their eyes quick, their difeourfe wanton, 
 and jelling, their adtions laughing, linging, playing, and dancing. 
 
 But flow low flats ftrike on the balfes, and tenor notes moves 
 the minde to a dull ftupidity, wherein the thoughts lie as dead, 
 this makes the body appear like fenflefs ftatues of Hone, 
 without motion, the head bending down, the eyes fixt to the 
 ground. 
 
 But Cramatick mufick is like Schools difputation,and difeord 
 in mufick, is like quarrelling, thele are the grounds of mufical 
 dilcourfes, or difeourfes in mufick. 
 
 Mufick hath a lympathie to the rational motions, becaufe the 
 rational fpirits move in number and meafure, as mufical inftru- 
 ments do. 
 
 Thus as notes are fet, the thoughts are placed, and as the 
 notes change in feveral tunes, fo the thoughts move in feveral 
 paflions, and as notes are compofed, fo are thoughts, as fern- 
 brim of thoughts, a lull note is a flxt thought. 
 
 Thus according as the notes and thoughts agree, the minde, 
 and mufick makes a harmony, if I have not matched my ftrains 
 ■end notes, with words and thoughts properly, let thofe that un- 
 derftand mufick , and Rhetorick mend it , for I underftand 
 neither, having neither fed at the full table, nor drank at the 
 full head of learning, but lived alwayes upon fcattered crums,

which I pick up here and there, and like a poor la he begger* 
 that had rather feed on fcraps then work, or be induftrious 
 to get wealth, fo I had rather write by gueffe, then take the 
 pains to learn every nice diftin&ion. 
 
 And if my book will not pleafe the learned, yet it may 
 pleafe the vulgar, whofe capacity can onely dig in the earth, 
 being not able to reach the celcftial Orbs by fpeculation. 
 
 Chap. 208. The knowledge of difeafes . 
 
 I T is not fufficient for Phyfitians to ftudy the names of difea- 
 fes, and to know onely lo much, as to diftinguifh onekinde 
 of diieaie from another, as we fhould diftinguifh man from 
 beaft, or fo,as a horfe from a cow,or as that horle is a barbe, or 
 a coarfer, or a genet, or a Turk, or an Arabian, but that this 
 barbe, is not that barbe, or this genet is not that genet, and the 
 like. Likewife to know the nature fo, as to know how to ufe 
 it, and what fit to apply to it ^ as for example, a man buyes 
 a horfe, and he having onely an old faddle, that he was accufto- 
 med to ride with on a horfe he formerly had, put it on his 
 lOw horfes back, yet although his horfe is of the fame Country, 
 or fort of horfes, as his former horfe was, yet the faddle 
 may not be fit for the new horfe, but may be either too big or 
 too little, and by the unfitneffe may gall his horfe fo lore, 
 and corrupt the flcfh fo much, as he may be a fcald back jade,, 
 as long as he lives, if it fefters not as to kill him 5 fo in dif- 
 eai'es medicines may be too ftrong, or too weak, or they may e- 
 vacuate too much or too little,if they do not not know the juft 
 dimenfion, and extention of the difeafe. Again, one the fame 
 fort of horfes may be fo dull, as hardly to move out of his 
 pace with the fpur, although it fhould prick fo deep, as to make 
 his fides to bleed, when another horfe of the fame lort, fhall 
 run away, over hedg, and ditch, againft trees, and ftones, untill 
 he hurt himfelf, and dings his rider, or at leaft fiings,and leap?* 
 and fnorts, and ftamps ; and grows into a furious heat; fo dif- 
 eafes, fome muft be handled gently, others more roughly ,-fbr 
 in difeafes you muft learn the difpofition of the difeafe, as well 
 of what kinde, fort, or breed it is ; fo likewife it is not enough 
 for a phyfitian to know what drugs will purge choler, what 
 fiegme, and what melancholy, or the like ; but they fhould 
 ftudy to know the feveral motions, which work in them, or 
 elfe their operations will be as their imploiments are , which 
 is chance-medly 5 for otherwife a Phyfitian neither applies 
 his medicines knowingly ,nor skilfully, but cuftomarily,becaufe 
 they are ufually given in fuch difeafes, whereof f ome do mend* 
 others do die with them ^ but certain if Phyfitians would take 
 pains to ftudy the feveral motions of the diieafes,and alfo of the 
 drugs, and medicines they give, and would do as skilful mu- 
 fitians, which make a coniort,where although every one plaies 
 
 upon

uppn a fevml iiifttument , yet they all make their notes 
 agree, there would follow ahafmony of health in the body, 
 as well as u. harmony of mufick in thefe contorts. 
 
 But as I faid before it is not fufficient to know how to purg 
 choler, -ft'egme, Melancholy, and the like, for the purg- 
 ing of thofe humors doth not alwayes work cures ; for fome 
 difeafes do not alwayes, proceed fo much from the loofe hu- 
 mours in the body, as the difordered motions in the body; 
 for choler, flegme, melancholy; are not fuperfluous humors of 
 the body; unleffe the quantity of each be too much; for the na- 
 ture of the body, for' thofe humours, are part of the body, and 
 the body could not fubfift without them, for they are feveral 
 mixtures, which ferve to the confiftance of the figure, and 
 as lome humours, make and mix fuch humours, fo other mo- 
 tions carry the humour like tempered matter, or lime to the 
 creations or reparations of the figure, which is the body ; and 
 if there were none of thofe humours, the figure would- no 
 more ftand, if once a decaying, no more then a houfe which 
 runs to mine for want of {tone, brick, wood, or morter, or 
 the like- 1 befides, if there were hot llegme, choler, would 
 do like a coach wheel, for want of moilture, the moti<Ss 
 would fet the body on fire, and il no choler, the flegme would 
 drown it, and if neither flegme nor choler, muddy melancholy 
 would dam , or flop it up. 
 
 But Phyfitians fhould ftudy difeafes fo, as they may be able 
 to diftinguifh them,as we do the different faces of mankinde, 
 or any other ; for there are as many feveral kindes of difeafes, 
 as there are animals, and as much difference in one, and the 
 fame kinde, as there are in the feveral fhapes, and countenan- 
 ces to the body and nature, and difpofition of the minde; be- 
 fides, difeafes are like parents, and children, as the childe 
 may refemble the parent , or the children of the fame parents 
 may refemble one another, and yet they are not all one ; A- 
 gain,dileafes may be like half brothers, or lifters, as fome may 
 have all one mother, but not one father ; fo fome difeafes may 
 be produced, partly from fuch a caufe,and partly from another. 
 Again, difeaies may be matcht, and lome to be like widows, 
 and widows that marry again, fo dileafes may be loofe, or be 
 quit of fuch a producing caufe, and joyn with another. 
 
 As for example, a cold ftomaek is a dileale, and a hot liver 
 is a difeafe, and both may produce fuch dileales; perchance the 
 cold ftomaek, may be cured, but not the hot liver, when the 
 cold ftomaek is cured, the hot liver is a widow, which after- 
 wards may chance to match with a cold melancholy fpleen, or 
 two or thre, or more difeaies, may be matched together; as if 
 a man fhould have two or three wives, or a woman as many 
 husbands; likewife feveral accidents may be matched, or at 
 leaft commit adultery, and get baftardly children. 
 
 As for example, a great heat may be matched or joyned 
 
 with

 with a fuddcn cold, which may produce a great fever or other 
 difeafes that ufually follow , and milions of the like, exam- 
 ples may bee given. But I defire my Readers, that they may 
 not condemn my companions, as extravagant, and too ran- 
 taftical lor lo grave a lubjedR but I could finde no fitter to ex- 
 prelfe my meaning , which is onely that I w r ould have Phy- 
 litians, as skilful, knowing and learned in difeafes, as they are 
 in the cuftoms, manners, humours, and perlons oi men, and 
 that they may as knowingly diftiugnifh the difference, alterati- 
 ons, degrees, and alliances of difeafes, as they do the feveral 
 fexes, faces, countenance, dilpofitions and qualities of men. 
 
 Befides,who knovves but that the very thoughts of men may 
 be known by the temper of their body? for could men come 
 but to learn the feveral motions of the body, which ingenious 
 oblervations may come to do, they may ealily come to learn 
 the motions of the minde , and fo come to know the thoughts, 
 which thoughts are the feveral figures therein, which figures 
 moft commonly move fympathetically, with the motions of 
 the body;

 which I hope all is ; for I had never any guide to dired me, 
 nor intelligence from any Authors, to advertife me, but write 
 according to my own natural cogitations, where if any do 
 write after the lame manner in what language foever, that 
 they will remember my work is the original ol their difeourfe, 
 but they that Real out my opinions, or "compare them to old 
 opinions, that are nothing alike, as if one fhould liken to 
 men that had neither femblance in features, countenance, pro- 
 portion, nor complexion, becaufe they are two men, as be- 
 ing of madkinde, lurely they might be judged to be fools; bur\ 
 may all fuch be condemned, as lalfe, malicious, ridiculous or 
 mad.

This Chapter although it belongs to another book , yet l thought it 
 fit to joyn it to this dificourfe . 
 
 Chap. 210. The diatical Centers. 
 
 A Lthough infinite matter and motion was from all eter- 
 nity ; yet that infinite moving matter is difpofed by an 
 in finite Deity, which hath power to order that moving mat- 
 ter, as that Deity plcafeth, by reafon there is nothing greater 
 then it fell, therfore there is nothing that can oppofe its 
 will. 
 
 Likewifethis Deity is as the center of infinite moving mat- 
 ter, for though there can be no center in infinites, by reafon 
 there is no circumference, yet in refpeft the matter is infinite 
 every way from, and to this Deity ; we may lay the Deity is 
 the center of infinite matter, and by reafon, the infinite mo- 
 ving matter, liowesas much to this diatical, center, as from 
 it , it doth as it were prefent it felf, or rather is forced to be 
 ordered, by its infinite wifdom, which otherwife it would 
 run into an infinite confufion, with which there would be an 
 infinite,horrid and eternal war in nature; and though this Deity 
 is as the center to infinite matter, yet this Deity in it felf is as 
 infinite matter, for its wifdom is as infinite as matter, and its 
 knowledge as infinite as its wifdom, and its power as 
 infinite as both, and the effe&s of thefe attributes run with in- 
 finite matter, like infinite paralel lines, even and ftraight, 
 notcroffing, nor obftru&ing, nor can they circumference or 
 circle in each other, the matter and the Deity being both in- 
 finite neither is the matter or Deity finite to, or in them- 
 felves, for infinite matter hath no end, or period , nei- 
 ther can the infinite Deity comprehend it felf, fo as it 
 is a ; god to it felf, as well, or as much as to matter; for 
 this Deity is no wayes finite, neither to its felf, nor matter, 
 its knowledge being as infinite as its power, and its wifdom 
 as infinite^its knowledge, and its power as infinit as both, and 
 being infinit, its wifdom cannot be above its power, nor its 
 power beyond its wifdom, neither can its knowledge compre- 
 hend its power, or the wayes of its wifdom being all infinite 
 and eternal. 
 
 And though nature is infinit matter, motion and figure crea- 
 ting all things out of its felf, for of matter they are made, and 
 by motion they are formed into leveral and particular figures, 
 yet this Deity orders and difpofes of all natures works.

 G Reat God, from thee all infinites do flow ; 
 
 And by thy power from thence effe&s do grow ; 
 
 Thou ordereft all degrees of matter, juft 
 As t’is thy will and pleafure move it muft. 
 
 And by thy knowledge orderd’ft all the beft. 
 
 For in thy knowledge doth thy wifdom reft ; 
 
 And wifdom cannot order things amifs. 
 
 For where diforder is, no wifdom is. 
 
 Befides, great God, thy will is juft, for why ? 
 
 Thy will ft ill on thy wifdom doth rely. 
 
 O pardon Lord, for what, I now hear fpeak ^ * 
 
 Upon a gueffe, my knowledge is but weak; 
 
 But thou haft made fuch creatures as mankinde. 
 
 And gav’ft them fomthing which we cal a mind, 
 
 Alwayes in motion, never quiet lies. 
 
 Untill the figure, of his body dies. 
 
 His feveral thoughts , which feveral motions are 
 Do raife up love, hope, joyes, doubts and feare; 
 
 ( As love doth raife up hope, fo fear doth doubts — * 
 
 which makes him feek to find the great God out; 
 
 Self love doth make him feek to hnde, if he 
 Came from, or fhall laft to eternity ; 
 
 But motion being flow,makes knowledge weak. 
 
 And then his thoughts ’gainft ignorance doth beat. 
 
 As fluid waters ’gainft hard rocks do flow. 
 
 Break their foft ftreams, & fo they backward go: 
 
 Juft fo do thoughts, & then they backward Aide, 
 
 Unto the place, where firft they did abide ; 
 
 And there in gentle murmurs, do complain. 
 
 That all their care and labour is in vain; 
 
 But fince none knows, the great Creator muft, 
 
 Man feek no more, but in ms greatnefs truft.

I Finde fince I have read my book over, I could have enlarged 
 that pare of my book that treats of difeafes, much to the ad- 
 vantage ; but I mu ft intreat my noble Readers, to remem- 
 ber there are natural humors , and metamorphofed humors, 
 which are wrought by feveral motions, as thofc of Elements ; 
 Alfo that there are natural contractions, attractions, retentions, 
 digeftions, delations, expulftons; Likevvife that there are un- 
 natural of all thefe motions : that is, fuch as are proper or im- 
 proper to the the natural health, or confiftence of the feveral 
 parts and the generality of the whole figure. Alfo that the mo- 
 tions that make the humor, and the motions that move the 
 humor may be quite different, and fome parts of a humor may 
 be made by fome forts of motions, and fome by other forts of 
 motions, where my difcourle of the motions which makes the 
 Elements will enlighten the Readers.
