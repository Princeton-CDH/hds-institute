TO
Sir HANS SLOANE,
Prefident.
And to the Reft of the COLLEGE
of PHYSICIANS.
GENTLEMEN,
Receiv'd the following Account of the
Method and Succefs of inoculating the
Small-Pox in New-England, from a Per-
fon there,of great Learning and Probity,
who defir'd his Name might be conceal'd;
having no other View, than a charitable Inclination
of doing Good to the World. It feemed to him (as
I must freely own it does to me) a Matter of great
Importance to the Welfare of Mankind; and if you,
Gentlemen, thall be in the fame Sentiment, I have
no doubt, but it will find your Favour and Encou
ragement.
Altho' this Practice of ingrafting the Small-Pox
has been ufed from Time immemorial among the
Circaffians, and for many Years paft in the Levant,
yet it is a new Thing in thefe Parts of Europe, and
ftill more fo in America: And as all new Difcoveries,
however rational in themfelves, and beneficial to
Mankind, are receiv'd at firft with Oppofition,
none has met with greater than this in New-England.
A vaft Number of honeft People quarrel'd with
it upon religious Scruples; and they were strongly
fupported by the Phyficians of the Place, for Reafons
of a very different Kind, which it is not at all ne-
ceffary to mention. But as Truth is mighty, and
will at last prevail, the great and furprizing Succefs
of this Practice, has convinc'd every reaſonable Ad-
verfary, and filenc'd the moft obftinate. It has been
try'd on all Ages, and both Sexes; on every Confti-
tution, the Robuft, and the Infirm; on the moft cch-
trary Complexions, the Blacks, and the Whites; and
in each extreme Seafon of the Year, the Summer and

cond Fever, or, indeed, any confiderable Diftrefs
On the contrary, the Patients have been fo eafy,
during the whole Courfe of the Diftemper, that it
was hard to perfwade them that they were really
Patients. I muft alfo obferve, that there was no
antecedent Preparation of their Bodies; but they
have thefe two Advantages, which are fufficient :
One, that they know when they receive the Diftem-
per, (which thofe who are infected in the common
Way can't be fenfible of) and from that Time ufe a
regular Diet; the other, that there is fuch a plentiful
Difcharge at the Incifion-Sores, as prevents any fatal
Confequences; which is demonftrable from this Ob-
fervation, that the Eruptions are more or lefs, in
Proportion to thofe Difcharges. I am inclin'd to
think, that the Eafe and Security which attend this
Operation, may be entirely accounted for from thefe
two Principles, without having Recourfe to any other
Reafons. But as this is a fpeculative Point, You,
Gentlemen, are the beft Judges of it; and to your
great Learning and Knowledge it is fubmitted. I
hope fome of your Body, will give the World an
Account of the late Inoculation of Mr. Colt's Chil-
dren, who underwent this Operation upon the Re-
lation I gave my worthy Friend, their Father, and
this ingenious Lady, of what had been done in
New-England. They were vifited by 15 Gentlemen
of the Faculty, who were Witneffes how exactly it
anfwer'd in every Refpect. The Pocks came out
well, appear'd fair, round, and yellow; and regular
with refpect to Time, like the true, natural, diftinct
Kind; and the Children are perfectly well recover'd.
It is alfo particularly to be remark'd, that they were
never affected with the ufual Diforders, and bad
Confequences, that attend this very loathfome and
angerous Difeafe.
I AM afraid I have been too prolix, and therefore
Thall add no more, but that I am, with all imagi-

A N
ACCOUNT
OF THE

O F
Inoculating the Small-Pox.
SIR,
A
Gentleman well known in the
City of Bofton, had a Garamantee
Servant, who first gave him an
Account, of a Method fre-
quently ufed in Africa, and
which had been practis'd on him-
felf, to procure an eafy Small Pox, and a perpe-
tualecurity of neither dying by it, nor being
again infected with it.
Afterwards he fucceffively met with a Num-
ber of Africans; who all, in their plain Way,
without any Combination, or Correfpondence,
agreed in one Story, viz. that in their Country

the Small-Pox gets among them) it is now be-
come a common Thing to cut a Place or two in
their Skin, fometimes one Place, and fome-
times another, and put in a little of the Mat-
ter of the Small-Pox; after which, they, in a
few Days, grow a little Sick, and a few Small-
Pox break out, and by-and by they dry away;
and that no Body ever dy'd of doing this,
nor ever had the Small Pox after it: Which
laft Point is confirm'd by their conftant At-
tendance on the Sick in our Families, without
receiving the Infection; and, fo confiderable
is the Number of thefe in our Neighbourhood,
that he had as evident Proof of the Practice,
Safety, and Succefs of this Operation, as we
have that there are Lions in Africa.
After this, he heard it affirm'd, That it is
no unufual Thing for our Ships on the Coaft
of Guinea, when they fhip their Slaves, to
find out by Enquiry which of the Slaves
have not yet had the Small-Pox; and fo carry
them a-fhore, in, this Way to give it to them,
that the poor Creatures may fell for a better
Price; where they are often (inhumanly enough)
to be difpos'd of.
Some Years after he had receiv'd his first
African Informations, he found publish'd in
our Philofophical Tranfactions, divers Commu-
nications from the Levant, which, to our
Surprize, agreed with what he had from
Africa.
First, That very valuable Perfon, Dr. Ema-
nel Timonius, writes from Conftantinople, in De-
cember
(3)
cion.
cember 1713, That the Practice of procuring
the Small-Pox, by a Sort of Inoculation, had
been introduc'd among the Conftantinopolitans,
from the more Eastern and Northern Afiaticks,
for about forty Years. At the first (he fays)
People were cautious and afraid; but the happy
Succefs on Thouſands of Perfons, for (then)
eight Years paft, had put it out of all Sufpi-
His Account is, That they who have
this Inoculation practis'd upon them, are fubject
to very flight Smptoms, and fenfible of but
very little Sicknefs; nor do what Small Pox
they have, ever leave any Scars or Pits behind
them. They make Choice of as healthy a
young Perfon as they can find, that has the
Small Pox of the beft Sort upon him; on the
Twelfth or Thirteenth Day of his Decumbiture,
with a Needle they prick fome of the larger
Pufules and prefs out the Matter coming from
them into fome convenient Vellel, which is to
be ftopt clofe, and kept warm, in the Bofom of
the Perfon that carries it to the intended
Patient. This Perfon ought rather to be fome
other, than he who visited the fick Chamber
for it; left he fhould carry the Infection
in the common Way, which might prove dan-
gerous. The Patient is to have feveral
Small Wounds made with a Needle, or Lancet,
in two or more Places of the Skin, (the best
Places are the Mufcles of the Arm) and im-
mediately let there be dropt out a Drop of the
Matter in the Glafs on each of the Places,
and mix'd with the Blood that is iffuing out.
The Wound fhould be cover'd with fome little
Concave Veffel, and bound over, that the Mat-
ter may not be rubb'd off by the Garments,
for
A 2

for a few Hours. And now, let the Patient
(having Fillets on the Wounds) keep Houfe,
and be careful of his Dict. The Custom at
Conftantinople, is to abftain from Flesh and
Broth for twenty Days, or more; and they
chufe to perform the Operation, either in the
Beginning of the Winter, or the Spring: The
Small Pox begins to appear fooner in fome than
in others; and with letter Symptoms in fome
than in others; but with bappy Success in all.
Commonly ten or twenty Puftules break out;
here and there one has no more than two or
three, few have an Hundred: There are fome
in whom no Puftules rife, but in the Places
where the Incifion was made: And here the
Tubercules will be purulent; yet even theſe
have never had the Small-Pox afterwards, tho'
they have cohabited with Perfons that had it
on them. No fmall Quantity of Matter will
run, for feveral Days, from the Places of the
Incifion; but the Pocks arifing from the Opera-
tion, are dry'd up in a little while, and fall of,
partly in thin Skins, and partly vanishing by
an infenfible Wafting: The Matter being hard-
ly fo thick a Pus as in the common Small Pox;
tho', at the Places of the Incifion, 'tis more of the
common Sort; and there the Scars will always
remain, as Remembrancers of it. If an A-
poftem fhould break out in any, (which is more
frequent in Infants) yet there is no Fear; for
'tis healed fafely by Suppuration: In fine, this
learned Perfon affures us, that he never yet
obferv'd any bad Confequence of the Practice,
which now fo many come into.
After
After this, we find an honourable Perfou,
whofe Name is Jacobus Pyla inus, the Foneti in
Conful at Smyrna, (who was, I fuppofe, wholly
a Stranger to what had been written by the foi-
mer) publishing what is entitled, Nota, ac Tuta
Variolas Excitandi per Transplantationem Methodus
This Gentleman obferves, that this wonder.
ful Invention, was first, à plebeit udig, Gente,
in Humani Generis adjumentum in faviffimi
Morbi folamen detecta, found out, not by the
learned Sons of Eudition, but by a mean,
coarfe, rude Sort of People, for the Succour
of Mankind, under and against one of the
moft cruel Difeafes in the World. It was
rarely, if ever ufed among People of Quality,
till after the Beginning of the prefent Cen-
tury. A noble Grecian happening then to
try it with happy Succefs upon four little
Sons in his own Family. Mirum quam mul-
tas Nobiliorum Familias ad Imitationem traxit.
It was wonderful to fee how many People of
Fashion prefently follow'd the Example; fo
that at this Day (he fays) every one does,
without any Hefitation, and with all the Secu
rity imaginable, practice the Transplantation,
except here and there a few Cowards, that
are afraid of their Shadows. Indeed, the Turks,
who afcribe all Events to Fate, for that Rea-
fon come but flowly into it.
The Inftructions given by Pylarinus about
the Operation, differ little from thofe of
Timonius,

Timonius, and fo there is no Need of repeating
them.
He adds, That fome do the Buſineſs with no
more than one Incifion.
H
The Ferment comes into Action fooner in
fome than in others; ufually 'tis on the feventh
Day, fometimes on the firft.
The Symptoms prove remifs, or intenfe, accord-
ing to the various Conftitutions of the Bodies.
The Small Pox proves of the diftinct Sort, and
there are but few of them.
In fome few, the Incifion has produc'd no
Small Pox at all; but the Perfons have after-
wards been taken in the common Way, and
handled with it like other People.
The Wounds made for the Incifion, prove
often very fore, and with fome they degene-
rate into Apoffems; nay, they fwell fome-
times, and rife and fall, and rife again. There
has alfo happen'd on this Occafion, an Abfcefs
with Suppuration, in fome Emun&tory of the
Body; but this is a rare Occurrence.
In fine, Pylarinus affirms, it was hardly ever
known, that there was any ill Confequence
of this Tranfplantation. Quinimò ritè recéq;
tradata, & in Carporibus per peritum Medicum
apte preparatis, certifimam promittit Salutem.
The Bufinefs being well, and wifely manag'd,
and the Body being, by a fkilful Phyfician,
well
(77
well prepar'd, you may depend upon it. (He
fays) in an ordinary Way, there can be nothing
but a good Iffue of it.
After theſe Communications, and the Thing
eftablish'd in the Mouths of two fuch Witneffes,
we met with fome ingenious Travellers, who
knew fo much of the Matter, as very much
to confirm the Ideas we had entertain'd of
it.
Were one of an ordinary Capacity (for no
better is he that is now writing) willing
to try a little how far Philofophy might
countenance the Matter: One might think,
the venemous Miafms of the Small Fox, en-
tering into the Body, in the Way of Infpi-
ration, are immediately taken into the Blood
of the Lungs; and, I pray, how many Pulfes
pafs, before the very Heart is pierc'd with
them? And within how many more they are
convey'd into all the Bowels, is eafily appre
hended, by all who know any Thing how
the Circulation of the Blood is carry'd on; at
the fame Time the Bowels themfelves are
infeebled, and their Tone impair'd, by the
Venom that is thus infinuated. Behold the
Enemy at once got into the very Center of the
Citadel, and the invaded Party must be very
ftrong indeed, if it can ftruggle with him,
and after all entirely expel and conquer him:
Whereas the Miafms of the Small-Pux, being
admitted in the Way of Inoculation, their
Approaches are made only by the Out-Works
of the Citadel, and at a confiderable Diſtance
from it. The Enemy, 'tis true, gets in fo
far,

(8)
far, as to make fome Spoil; even fo much as
to fatisfy him, and leave no prey in the Body
of the Patient, for him ever afterwards to
feize upon; but the vital Powers are kept fo
clear from his Affaults, that they can manage
the Combat bravely; and tho' not without a
Surrender of thoſe Humours in the Blood, which
the Invader makes a Seizure on, they oblige
him to march out the fame Way he came in, and
are fure of never being troubled with him
any more. If the Vermicular Hypotheſis of the
Small Pox be receiv'd with us, (and it be,
as many now think, an animaculated Business)
there is lefs of Metaphor in our Account, than
may be at first imagin'd.
But to what Purpofe is all this Jargon? And
of what Significancy are most of our Specu-
lations? EXPERIENCE! EXPERIENCE!
'tis to THEE that the Matter muft be referr'd
after all; a few Empericks here, are worth all
our Dogmatifts.
About three Months ago, the Small Pox broke
in upon the City of Boston, where it very
much appeard with the Terrors of Death to the
Inhabitants. On this Occafion, there was ad-
drefs'd a Letter to the Phyficians of the City,
with an Account of the Communications from
the illuftrious Timonius, and Pylarinus, entreat-
ing them to meet for a Confultation upon it,
Whether the new Practice might be introduc d and
countenanc'd among us? The Writer was per-
fwaded, that herein he did but his Duty, and
exprefs'd no other than the Charity of a Chri-
fian, and a proper Concernment and Com-
paffion
༨ པ ༠༢ ༦
(9)
paffion for his poor Neighbours, whom he
faw likely to die by Hundreds about him.
His Addrefs found (for what Reatons I know
not, or am not willing to know) an indecent
Reception with our Phyntians; all the Return
he had, was a Story which they spread about
the Town and Country, that he had given an
unfaithful Account of the Matter to them, tho'
they had it in the printed Philofophical Tranf
actions before their Eyes to juftily it. Then
the Story was turn'd, that either Dr. Halley
had fupprefs'd Part of the true Account,or Timo-
nius and Pylarinus were themfelves fallacious:
Nevertheless, one who had been a more fuc-
cefsful Practitioner than moft of them, and had,
with a fingular Dexterity in his Practice,
perform'd Things not attempted by any of
them, (namely, Mr. Zabdiel Boylflon) was
prompted, by his enterprizing Genius, to begin
the Operation. He thought it most generous
to make his first Beginning upon his own
Family; and here, to make not only two Slaves,
but a beloved Son of his own, (about five or
fix Years of Age) the Subjects of it: He made
the Tranfplantation into them with two or
three Incifions a-piece, taking the Leg as well
as the Arm, (and in one of them the Neck)
for the Places of them: He did not uſe the
Precaution of fending for the fermenting Pus by
a third Perfon: He fraid not for what fome
would, have thought more proper Seafons; but
he did it in the very Heat of Midfummer,
which, with us, is hot enough: He did no-
thing at all to prepare their Bodies; and he
chofe to leave them to the Liberties, which
Perfons infected with the Small-Pox in the

( 10 )
common Way, do generally take, before their
Decumbiture, without any Letriment
them.
Under all thefe Difadvantages, did this
Gentleman make his Experiments; but they
fucceeded to Admiration About the fetventh
Day the Patients began to grow Feverish, and
out of Order; on the third and fourth Day
from their falling ill, his Child's Fever grow
to an Heighth, beyond his Expectation, which
(from the Novelty of the Bufinels) did, for a
few Hours, confiderably territy him: He had
Recourfe to the common Remedies of Blifters,
and gave the Child a Vomit, and prefently all
the Fright was over: The Eruption began;
and from the Time of its doing fo with the
Child, and with the two Slaves, there was no
Occafion for any other Medicine; they were
eafy from this Time; their Fuftules (which
were, tho' not many, yet fomewhat more for
Number, than what is ufual in the Levant)
grew, and fell off, as they do in the Levant;
and their Sores, which had an agreeable Dif-
charge at them, feafonably dry'd up of them-
felves; and they all prefently became as
hail and ftrong as ever they were in their
Lives.
It is incredible, what a Storm was rais'd,
and very much of it principally owing to
fome of our enrag'd Phyficians, on this Occa-
fion.
The Gentleman was threaten'd with an
Indictment for Felony; (tho', in your Country,
they
ť
༨༦༦༨༤
(11)
they talk of no fuch Thing, for them who
carry their Children into infected Chambers, on
Perpofe to make them take the Infection after
the common Way in their Minority) and Words
were given out, which had a Tendency to raiſe
the Mob upon him.
The Select Men (ani Order of Men, who are
the Overfeers and Managers of the Town-Affairs)
affociating with fome of the Justices, order'd
him to appear before them, and feverely re-
primanded him for fpreading the Small-Pox;
(which was already fpreading in the common
Way) and with high Menaces warned him
againft proceeding with his Practice any far-
ther. At the fame Time, the Practitioners of
the Town publish'd a Declaration, That the
Inoculation of the Small-Pox had prov'd the

that about five and twenty Years ago, there
were thirteen Soldiers in the French Army,
upon whom this Operation was perform'd;
but four dy'd of it; and when they were
open'd, horrid Things were found in them;
fix recover'd with abundance of Trouble, be-
ing feiz'd with Tumours, and large Inflama-
tions; the other three found no Effect of it
upon them. He fwore likewife, that in Flan-
ders, twenty Years ago, a Captain, under his.
Cure for the Small-Pax, told him, that ten
Years before this, he had been inoculated five
or fix Times, without that curfed Invention's
taking Effect upon him; and he was fo vio-
lently feiz'd, that he had feveral Ulcers on
his Body, efpecially one on his Arm, which
was incurable. He fwore likewife, that at
the Pattle of Almanza in Spain, two Muscovite
Soldiers had the Operation perform'd on them;
and that one recover'd, and the other felt no Im-
preffion; but fix Weeks after, a Frenzy feiz'd
him, and he was fwell'd all over his Body, and
thought to be poifon'd; but his Body being
open'd, his Lungs were found ulcerated, which
the Phyficians concluded was the Effect of
the Inoculation. Things which Mafter Apella
himfelf would fearce imagine to be credible!
This notable Teftimony was corroborated
with one or two more, which amaunted to
little more than this, That a Man in the
Mediterranean, many Years ago, was told by
fomebody, that fomebody told him, that fome
body heard, that the Doctors in the Archipelago
warned People against Inoculation of the Small-
Pox, as a dangerous Practice.

At the fame Time, there was publish'd in
our News Letter, a bitter Satyr upon Dr.
Boylfton for his late Action; and his putting
this far fetch'd, and (it was pleas'd to fay)
not well vouch'd Method, into Practice. They
compar'd it to the Infufion of the Venom
of Serpents, or the Oil of Tobacco, by In-
jection, immediately into the Mafs of Blood;
and affirm'd, that it would produce only an
eruptive Fever; but nothing Analogous to the
Small-Pox; (tho they inveigh'd against the
Gentleman for fpreading the Small-Pox in
what he did) and that the Sufferers might,
notwithstanding, receive the Small-Pox after-
wards in the ordinary Way: They alſo af
ferted, that the Thing had been among the
Learned univerfally known in England, above
twenty Tears; (and more than twice feven
Years before, the Secretary of the ROYAL
SOCIETY first recommended it as a new Thing,
inviting the Thoughts of the Curieus in the
English Nation upon it) but it had never been
practis'd, becaufe it was deem'd wicked and
felonious; and then they referr'd the CASE
to the Divines, which was exprefs'd in thefe
emphatical Terms: How the truffing more
the groundless Machinations of Men, than
to our Preferver in the ordinary Courfe of Na-
ture, may be confiftent with that Devotion and
Subjection we owe to the All wife Providence of
God Almighty. Six of our Minifters thought
themfelves bound in Duty to beftow a publick
Rebuke upon this indecent Satyr; and anfwer'd
the CASE not much to the Satisfaction of

fome that offer'd it. But the Rage of the
People, was, with a very powerful Pharmacy,
boil'd up to a very great Extremity; and
for the more effectual enraging of them,
there was a ftrange Ufe made of a Pallage,
that one must have had the Senfe of three
Men in him, to have made fuch a Conftru-
ction of it. Pylarinus had faid, That fome-
times an Abfcefs happen'd in Jome Emundtory
of the Body; which yet (he faid) was a rare
Occurrence. Now, tho' our Gentlemen knew,
that this is a Thing which daily occurs, among
People recovering from the Small-Pox in the
ordinary Way; (and we had never feen any
Thing of it in our incifions Way) yet they
rais'd a horrible Cry of Raw Head and Bloody
Bones, that the Inoculation of the Small Pox
would bring in the Plague among us.
muft needs be fo, becaufe Plague Sores were
often in fome Emundtory of the Body; and fo
Bolton was going at once to be another
Marfeller and they had the Plague at Con-
antinople fince Inoculation had been admitted
there Our People were fear'd (I cannot fay)
out of their Wits. But the Gentleman having
fucceeded fo well in his firft Experiments, and
being perfwaded, that if God would pleaſe
to make him the happy Inftrument of fav-
ing the precious Lives of his poor Neigh-
bours, it would make amends for all the Ob-
loquies which his envious Brethren might raiſe
upon him: He took little Notice of the Inhi-
bition that had been given him. Divers pious
and worthy People confider'd how dreadfully
the Small-Pox handled many of their Neigh-
bours,
It
An
(15)
bours, and how much the fixth Commandment
order'd them the Ufe of Means to preferve
and prolong their Lives. They confider d
alfo, that, by managing and governing the
Approach of the Small-Pox, in the Way of
Inoculation, they had a Method of fecuring
their Lives from the Dangers of it; and that
there never arriv'd unto us a Medicine of fo
great a Recommendation; it having been uſed
upon fo many Thonfands, and never one known
to have mifcarry'd under it. They there-
fore apply'd themfelves to Dr. Boylston,
with Defires to come under the Operation;
and he charitably gratify'd them in the
Thing defir'd; tho' the Objects were moft
of them, either fo Old, or fo Weak, that
they would have been the last that one would
have chofen for it; and one would have
apprehended no little Hazard of the Event:
But they all got well and foon through it,
and fo much beyond their Expectation, that
they zealously gave Thanks to God, for
leading them into it; and ferioufly profefs'd
to their Neighbours, that they had rather
fuffer the Operation twice every Year, than
once to undergo the Small Pox, as it is moft
commonly fuffer'd, tho' they fhould be fure
of furviving it.
The Fever in thefe alfo, was, for a few
Hours before the Eruption, more Intenfe,
and the Puftules after it, were more nume-
rous, than what is ufual in the Levant
in a few Days, and much fooner than wha
is commonly done, where they have

Small-Pox the common Way, they reco

their entire Strength, and were, on all Ac-
counts, as well as they were before; and
the Sores of the Incifion alfo heal'd of them-
felves, rather fooner than they with'd for.
Whereupon, they publith'd a Leclaration in
our Gazette, that they might ſtop falfe Re-
ports, and fatisfy the Minds of fober People,
in the Midft of the Ephefian Clamours now
prevailing; for truly, while thefe Things
were doing, the Town was fill'd with Ini-
quity, to a Degree which good Men could not
obferve, without being more than a little griev'd
at it.
I muft fay it, I never faw the Devil fo
let loofe upon any Occafion. A lying Spirit
was gone forth at fuch a Rate, that there
was no believing any Thing one heard.
If the inoculated Patients were a little fickifh,
or had a Vomit given them, it was immedi-
ately reported, That they were at the point
of Death, or actually dead. While the Pati-
ents lay blefling and praifing Almighty
God, for fhewing them this eafy Way to efcape
a formidable Enemy, it was confidently re-
ported, That they bitterly repented of what had
been done upon them, and would not, upon any
Terms, be brought into it, if it were to do again.
When the Patients had their incifious Places,
either actually and perfectly heal'd in fome,
or within a Day or two of it in others, it
was confidently reported, That they were perifh-
ing under terrible Ulcers, and had their Arms or
Legs rotting off.

Thefe
(17)
#
Thefe, and the like Things, were af
ferted with fuch impudent Confidence, even
by fuch as liv'd in the nearest Neighbourhood,
that one was almoft ready to fear a Beating,
if they durft offer to question them. Then
the People would affert, that here were Per-
fons on the very Spot. who underwent the
Inoculation in England a great many Years ago;
but afterwards had the Small-Pox. in the com-
mon Way; and, they faid, they would
bring thefe Perfons to us. A few Minutes
after, they would affert, that it was never
practis'd in England; but there was an A
of Parliament which made it Felony; and,
they faid, they would produce the Act to us.
But never any Patient had fo many Puftules of
the Small-Pox, as there were Lies now daily
told, and fpread among our deluded People.
That which much added to the Mifery, was,
that the People who made the loude Cry,
(who most commonly were what we may not
improperly call of the confluent Sort, and fuch
alfo as were paft the Dangers of the Small-Pox
themſelves) had a very Satanic Funy acting them.
They were like the poffefs'd People in the Gospel,
exceeding fierce; infomuch, that one could fcarce
pafs by the Way where they were to be met
withal. Their common Way was to rail and
rave, and with Leath, or other Mifchiefs, to
them that practis 'd, or favour'd this devilish
Invention. To inflame them in their Tranf
ports, and harden them in their Violences and
Exclamations, they pretended Religion on their

Side; and charg'd all that were not fo, with
denying and renouncing the divine Providence,
and I know not how many more Abominations;
yea, with going to the Devil, and the God of
Ekron. And how ftrangely they treated the
moft mériterious Minifters of the Gospel, who
did not come into their Frenzies, I leave un-
mention'd. Father forgive them.
The View of thefe Things caus'd fome con-
fiderate Perfons to think, whether the Angel
of Death promifing himfelf a great Feaft in
this miferable City, it might not put him that
had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil, into
a great Rage, to fee coming in among us, a
Method of refcuing many Morfels from him..
They were fure, the Lying, and the Malice, and
the Outrage, that manag'd, and carry'd on the
Oppofition to it, muft needs be of a Satanic
Original; there could be nothing more contrary
to the Spirit of a meek JESUS.
But the Oppofers could not hinder the Pro-
felytes from increafing. Dr. Boylstone has his
Patients multiplying; and, inftead of any
one mifcarrying, they come off eafier, with
lefs Fever, and fewer Puftules, than thofe that
led the Van in his Experiments. He grows
more expert every Day; and many of the moft
vehement Opponents, daily come over to an
Approbation of the Practice; and People that
fee their Neighbours, either dying in a tragi-
cal Manner about them every Day, or, at best,
having their Loins fill'd with a loathfome Difeafe,
won't permit themfelves to be talked out of their
Lives, by pitiful Impertinencies.

(19)
Of what my ingenious Friend hitherto
does, and finds, you will now accept this brief
Account.
He makes ufually two Incifions, (tho' fome-
times but one) in the two Arms (or an Arm,
or a Leg) of his Patients; and then he puts
into.them a little Bit of Lint, which he has
dipp'd into the Quitter, that he had newly
fetch'd in a little Bottle, warm from the Puftules
of one who has the Small Pox of a good Sort,
now turning upon him. This he covers with
a little Plaifter of Diachylon, to keep it clofe
for two or three Days in its Operation there.
In his firft Practice, upon his removing the
little Pledget, the Sores of the Incifion would
fometimes beal up, and anon fwell and break
forth of themſelves, when the Fever came to
be over: But he thought afterwards, that by
keeping the Sores conftantly open, in the Way
we do an ordinary Iffue, the Fever, and other
Symptoms, prefently to come on, are fenfibly
moderated. He allows the Patients, for a-
while, to go abroad about their Bufinefs, if
the Weather be good, and there be no Danger
of getting any Cold; but he directs them to
regulate their Diet, and, particularly to re-
trench a little their Carnivorous Inclinations:
And yet he does little this Way, becauſe he
finds no great Advantage by thus enfeebling of
them.
About the feventh Day, (and fometimes a
little before, and fometimes a little after) the
C 2
Patients

(20)
Patients grow dull, and feel a feverish Difpo-
fition, and grumbling Pains of the Head and
Back, as in the Invafions of the Small Pox
'tis ufual. In fome, the Symptoms are very
Remifs, in others they are more Intenje. But
the Doctor governs the Fever at his Pleaſure,
in the Ways that every Body now treats a
common putrid Fever.
Sometimes on the third or fourth Day, the
Fever feems, for a few Hours, a little rampant;
but then he gives a gentle Vomit, and after-
wards a Blifter, and the Eruption begins with-
out fail immediately.
If you expect now a long Story about the
Managements in the Progrefs of the Diftemper,
I fhall difappoint you; for here's the End on't;
there's no more to be done; there's no farther
Illness; no farther Trouble; the Storm is over;
there is not one Atom of that fecond Fever,
which, in the Small Pox, is what People gene-
rally die of. The Patients have no more to
do, but lie fill, and keep warm, and entertain
their Friends. and ftudy how to glorify the
God of their Lives.
The Puftules in fome, have been very few,
perhaps twenty, or thirty, or fo; in others,
they have rifen to feveral Hundreds; yea, few
have come off without feveral Hundreds: In
this Point, that is to fay, the Number of the
Pufules, we differ from the Levant confiderably;
and are yet at a Lofs for a Reafon of it; but
in as few Days, as thofe of the ordinary diftin&t
Small Fox, they are gone.
The
21
The Sores continue running f what lon-
ger, (and longer in fome than in othais, even
fome Days after their ging abroad again.
But they dry up of thenieve, Tits, Cito, ac
Fucunde.
None of the inoculated Patients have vet had
any of thofe Boils, which People, icc verd of
the Small Pox in the or dinny Way alc com-
monly vexed withal. If there had been one
Inftance of them, our Practitioners would
have taught the People to dry, the Plague! the
Plague! upon it.
Thus Dr. Boylflon goes on with his Practice
bitherto fuccefsfully. There is one Difficulty,
indeed. which very much incumbers him. He
has employ'd the Inoculation upon one Perfon,
who, having been juft before tending two Pa-
tients that were under it, had very ftrongly
receiv'd the Infection in the common Way:
The Perfon was in a few Hours taken down,
and prov'd very full of the Small-Pox, of the
confluent Sort, and very narrowly escap'd with
Life; to the Prefervation whereof, it was yet
thought, that the running of the incifious Sores
might a little contribute.
The Mifcarriage of this Perfon would have
been, by the Mob as aforefaid, improv'd as a
fufficient Subject for their Exclamations. Tis
therefore no little Diftrefs to the Doctor, how
they that are already ftrongly infected, may be
eafily diftinguifh'd from thofe who are not fo,
in a Place where the Distemper is become Epi-
demical

demical; for the Condition of every one, will
not always allow them to perform the Qua-
rentine that would be neceffary for it. How
he will get over this Difficulty, 'tis yet
fuch early Days with us, that I cannot inform
you.
Our Practitioners, and the People under
their Influences, having had their other Preju-
dices confuted by the happy Experience of the
Neighbourhood, now chiefly infift upon this,
Well, two or three Tears hence you will fee the
dreadful Effects of this wicked Practice; you'll fee
what happens to the People that are under it. And
the fad Things that are to happen, when the
Lark time arrives, are now to terrify us. They
are fo unreafonable, that one had as good
fpeak Reafon to a Poft, or argue with a Whirl-
wind. Were a Borarius alive again, what
would he fay to fuch unreasonable Perfons. A cra-
zy old Man, that is near Seventy, having late-
ly enjoy'd the Benefit of Inoculation,'tis thought,
that if he fhould happen to die one Minute
before Ninety, thefe People (if not come to
their Wits before) will fay, This Inoculation
kill'd him.
It may, perhaps, a little divert you, to fee
the Humour on't.
A Negro, who pretends he can juſt remem-
her, that he was inoculated, when he was a
Pickaninny, in his own Country, perhaps thir-
ty Years ago, (and was here under Cure for
the French Pox, a little while ago) lately grew
indifpos'd, and was laid in a Room where
another
༢༦༠༨༤
( 23 )
another Negro lay, full of the Small Pox upon
him. At first it was confidently affirm'd, that
this Fellow had alfo the Small-Pox broke out
full
upon
him; and tho', till now, the men-
tion of a Negro (or of any Thing from Africa)
was hifs'd at, yet now, all on a fudden, a
Negro was become good Authority, and poor
Inoculation was like to be knock'd on the
Head.
But after the Fellow's lying many Days in
the infected Chamber, it is impoffible to pro-
duce the leaft Eruption of the Small-Pox upon
him. What is now to be done? Why, they
find fomething of a Swelling under his Arm;
and fome of our D-s cry out, that this is
the Small-Pox, in the Form, you muſt Note,
of a large Tumour; and this peftilential Form
is alfo owing to his Inoculation in his Infancy.
But among all the Opprefions, under which
this new Practice is a Sufferer among us, the
chief comes from a Scruple of Confcience, which,
no doubt, in many People, whofe Hearts are
better than their Heads, may be fincere and
ferious.
They plead, That the Whole bave no Need of
a Phyfician; and that it is not lawful for me
to make myself fick, when I am well; and bring
a Sicknefs on myfelf; no, tho' it be to prevent
a greater Sickness. 'Tis to no Purpoſe to tell
them, that they cavil againft the Ufe of all
preventing Phyfick; and that they confute them-
felves as often as they take a Vomit, or ufe a
Blifler

Blifter; and much more, if they undergo
Salivation (a Thing a thoufand Times worle
than the Difpumation which is now in Centro-
verfy) to prevent a Malady which may be
fear'd, but is not actually come upon them;
and that they are not the whole, while they
have the Fuel of the Small Pox lodg'd in them;
or are in that Anxiety of Mind about it, which
is, indeed, an evil Difeafe.
They plead, That what is now done, is a
Thing learnt from the Heathens; and it is not
lawful for Chriftians to learn the Way of the Hea-
then. 'Tis fo no Purpoſe to tell them, that
Hippocrates, and Galen were Heathen; and that
the Gentleman who invented the blundering
(but ftrangely ufeful) Compofition, call'd
Venice-Treacle, was an Heathen, who was Phy-
fician to no better a Man than a Neo: And
from whom is it that we have our Mithridate?
And how many noble Specificks have we
learnt from our Indians? And from whom did
they learn to finoak Tobacco; or drink Tea and
Coffee?
In fine, (tho' there is no End of their Follies)
while they have been taught the Clamour,
That we take up this new Thing from the Turks:
A Miftake; for it comes not from fuch, but
from the Greeks] Their main Cavil againft
it, were more fit for the Mouths of Turks,
and is the very Thing that keeps the Turks
from coming much into it: That God has
decreed when, and how we fhall dye, and for
us to pretend a Remedy that won't fail to
Save
RE
(25)
fave our Lives, and fecure us from Death by
the Small Pox, is to take the Work of God out
of his Hands. And how do we know, that
God will fend the Small-Pox upon us at all,
fince there will be fome that will efcape it,
where-ever it comes? "Tis to no Purpoſe to
attempt their Infruction; for if one does,
they will quickly, in exprefs Terms, tell
him, You shall never convince me. But that
they may convince us, that it is Religion which
inclines and fixes them, 'tis well if we don't
hear them fall to wishing of Miferies to them
that fhall try this new Practice, and railing
bitterly against the most venerable Servants
of God in the Land, and giving all the Signs
of a Satanic Energy upon them. Alas! pudet
bac opprobria.
To quiet the Minds of People that would
think foberly, the Doctor ftated the Cafe of Con-
Joience in thefe Terms,
Almighty God, in his great Mercy to
Mankind, has taught us a Remedy to be used,
when the Dangers of the Small Pox diftrefs
us; upon the Ufe of which Medicine, they
fhall, in an ordinary Way, be fure to have

confequently, not to be in fuch Danger of
dying by this dreadful Diftemper; as alfo to

which many of them, who recover of this
Diftemper, do fuffer from it. Whether a

him. What is now to be done? Why, they
find fomething of a Swelling under his Arm;
and fome of our D-s cry out, that this is
the Small-Pox, in the Form, you muft Note,
of a large Tumour; and this peftilential Form
is alfo owing to his Inoculation in his Infancy.
But among all the Oppreffions, under which
this new Practice is a Sufferer among us, the
chief comes from a Scruple of Confcience, which,
no doubt, in many People, whofe Hearts are
better than their Heads, may be fincere and
ferious.
They plead, That the Whole bave no Need of
a Phyfician; and that it is not lawful for me
to make myself fick, when I am well, and bring
a Sicknefs on myfelf, no, tho' it be to prevent
a greater Sickness. 'Tis to no Purpoſe to tell
them, that they cavil againft the Ufe of all
preventing Phyfick; and that they confute them-
felves as often as they take a Vomit, or ufe a
Blifler

Blifler; and much more, if they undergo
Salivation (a Thing a thoufand Times worfe
than the Difpumation which is now in Contro-
verfy) to prevent a Malady which may be
fear'd, but is not actually come upon them;
and that they are not the whole, while they
have the Fuel of the Small Pox lodg'd in them;
or are in that Anxiety of Mind about it, which
is, indeed, an evil Difeafe.
They plead, That what is now done, is a
Thing learnt from the Heathens; and it is not
lawful for Chriftians to learn the Way of the Hea-
then. 'Tis fo no Purpofe to tell them, that
Hippocrates, and Galen were Heathen; and that
the Gentleman who invented the blundering
(but ftrangely ufeful) Compofition, call'd
Venice Treacle, was an Heathen, who was Phy-
fician to no better a Man than a Nero: And
from whom is it that we have our Mithridate?
And how many noble Specificks have we
learnt from our Indians? And from whom did
they learn to finoak Tobacco; or drink Tea and
Coffee?
In fine, (tho' there is no End of their Follies)
while they have been taught the Clamour,
That we take up this new Thing from the Turks:
[A Miftake; for it comes not from fuch, but
from the Greeks] Their main Cavil againſt
it, were more fit for the Mouths of Turks,
and is the very Thing that keeps the Turks
from coming much into it: That God has
decreed when, and bow we fhall dye, and for
us to pretend a Remedy that won't fail to
Save

fave our Lives, and fecure us from Death by
the Small Pox, is to take the Work of God out
of his Hands. And how do we know, that
God will fend the Small-Pox upon us at all,
fince there will be fome that will efcape it,
where-ever it comes? "Tis to no Purpofe to
attempt their Infruction; for if one does,
they will quickly, in exprefs Terms, tell
him, You shall never convince me. But that
they may convince us, that it is Religion which
inclines and fixes them, 'tis well if we don't
hear them fall to wishing of Miferies to them
that fhall try this new Practice, and railing
bitterly against the moft venerable Servants
of God in the Land, and giving all the Signs
of a Satanic Energy upon them. Alas! pudet
bac opprobria.
To quiet the Minds of People that would
think foberly, the Doctor ftated the Cafe of Con-
feience in thefe Terms,
Almighty God, in his great Mercy to
Mankind, has taught us a Remedy to be used,
when the Dangers of the Small Pox diftrefs
us; upon the Ufe of which Medicine, they
fhall, in an ordinary Way, be fure to have
it not fo feverely as in the other Way, and
confequently, not to be in fuch Danger of
dying by this dreadful Diftemper; as alfo to
be deliver'd from the terrible Circumftances
which many of them, who recover of this
Diftemper, do fuffer from it. Whether a
Christian may not employ this Medicine,
(let the Matter of it be what it will) and
humbly give Thanks to God for his good
Providence,

ble World; and humbly look up to his good
Providence (as we do in the Ufe of any other
"Medicine) for the Succefs of it?
And he thought it Anfwer enough to fay
upon it, It may feem flrange, that any Wife Chrifti-
an cannot answer it,
Sir, The Reafon of my thus giving you the
Story of the Way to fave the Lives of People,
and keep them eafy too, from one of the
moft formidable Difeafes in the World, thus
far practis'd and profper'd among us, is, be-
cauſe I imagine fo confiderate and charitable
a Mind as yours, may do fomething to bring
it into Confideration, How far the Thing may
be encourag'd in our Nation, where this Diftemper
fometimes makes terrible Ravages, and where
there are fo many Perfons of great Ranks and
Hopes, that would be very thankful for fome
Aurance of their Lives, in a Point wherein
they will always be hanging in doubt, till the
Small-Pox be over with them,
And then, the Reafon of my alfo giving
you the Story of the Oppofition which the Thing
has here met withal, and reporting fuch foolish
Things as might be better bury'd in Oblivion,
which yet I do without expofing the Name of
any Perfon, as if I had been vindictively in-
clin'd, I might have done; 'tis becauſe it's a
thoufand to one, that the Thing may meet
with the fame Oppofition (for the Corruptions and.
Weaknesses of People are the fame) on your Side of
the Water; and the Knowledge of what has oc
curr'd

curr'd bere, may be of fome Service, to arm you
agathft many of your Difcouragements. But I
Thall write a Treafe, rather than a Letter, if I
do not here break off.
I do it, with my hearty Wishes, that you
may be a great Bleffing to the World, and that
a World of People may fare the better for you.
What better can be with'd you? By,
Bofon in New
England, Sept.
